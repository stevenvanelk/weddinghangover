It wasn&apos;t. They have a lot of thoughts about queso though. Tonight Steve&apos;s drinking Founders Porter which he mistakenly calls Dark, Rich, and Sexy... Which while an apt description of the beer, so apt it&apos;s on the label, apparently it isn&apos;t the actual name of the beer. Steve also brags a little more about that Scarlet Lane Eirik Bloodaxe he has but isn&apos;t drinking yet. Dustin is drinking A Little Sumpin&apos; Sumpin&apos; Ale from Lagunitas. Then it&apos;s on to business as usual. Steve complains about people complaining on social media about their Apple computers and products just to get those sweet, sweet interactions. Dustin talks about how to handle shooting multiple locations when you&apos;re traveling and unfamiliar with the area. Steve pitches an idea to Dustin for a Super Mario Bros. themed stylized shoot that&apos;s captured entirely by drones so that the bride and groom can lay down and look 2D the whole time. Steve talks about the importance of shooting with your flash in manual mode as opposed to TTL... because he got mad about another thing he read on social media, per usual. Then Steve tells Dustin about Yongnuo gear and why he prefers their transmitters/receivers to Pocket Wizards. Dustin recaps some of his Kickstarter failures and tries to sell Steve on the concept of the Loop again. Then Dustin talks about a Kickstarter product that, hold on to your pants, actually shipped! He&apos;s talking about the brain melter itself, Zungle. Then Steve&apos;s daughter wakes up and they cut the episode short.</description><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

Then Steve&apos;s back on the Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane. He may never get over being sick as a result, but it&apos;s so worth it. Meanwhile, Dustin&apos;s drinking a clear liquid. Then Steve discusses a recent overpayment scam someone tried to pull on him pretending to be an independent filmmaker, and Dustin also talks about the overpayment scam someone tried to pull on him pretending to be photo editor for the Atlantic. Dustin shares a story about a family member that was affected by an overpayment scam, but didn&apos;t lose any money thankfully. Then Steve and Dustin move on to discussing flashes again, and like usual the talk turns to Yongnuo. We can&apos;t talk enough about this brand. Steve and Dustin discuss their plan of action for shooting in dark venues with no windows, dim lighting, and black ceilings (your typical anus venue). Steve and Dustin talk a little bit about making art vs. running a business. Finally Steve introduces a new segment we&apos;re calling Crazy Questions from the Internet (until we find a better name), wherein Steve and Dustin answer questions people asked on the internet... or questions you direct message to Steve on Twitter or Instagram. Questions cover the topics of what to charge when you&apos;re first starting out, where it&apos;s okay to buy cameras from, and what are some funny poses for your clients to do.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;On this episode Steve and Dustin discuss overpayment scams, but first they start with a quick apology because they didn&apos;t have time to make a video for everyone. Then Steve&apos;s back on the Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane. He may never get over being sick as a result, but it&apos;s so worth it. Meanwhile, Dustin&apos;s drinking a clear liquid. Then Steve discusses a recent overpayment scam someone tried to pull on him pretending to be an independent filmmaker, and Dustin also talks about the overpayment scam someone tried to pull on him pretending to be photo editor for the Atlantic. Dustin shares a story about a family member that was affected by an overpayment scam, but didn&apos;t lose any money thankfully. Then Steve and Dustin move on to discussing flashes again, and like usual the talk turns to Yongnuo. We can&apos;t talk enough about this brand. Steve and Dustin discuss their plan of action for shooting in dark venues with no windows, dim lighting, and black ceilings (your typical anus venue). Steve and Dustin talk a little bit about making art vs. running a business. Finally Steve introduces a new segment we&apos;re calling Crazy Questions from the Internet (until we find a better name), wherein Steve and Dustin answer questions people asked on the internet... or questions you direct message to Steve on Twitter or Instagram. Questions cover the topics of what to charge when you&apos;re first starting out, where it&apos;s okay to buy cameras from, and what are some funny poses for your clients to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Next up, Steve and Dustin discuss what they shot this weekend. Steve brags about his wife and her excellent work, while Dustin talks about shooting without his wife. The talk turns toward religion but quickly veers away as Steve and Dustin aren&apos;t equipped to discuss this topic at all. Dustin tries to talk about his experience in New York seeing a celebrities show, while Steve constantly interrupts him. Then finally, we move on to the good stuff. We talk about that new DJI Zenmuse x7 and Inspire 2 and how excited we are by this product. Dustin&apos;s a little jazzed about the new Sony a7S III, but since we don&apos;t know anything about it we quickly move onto Dustin playing around with the Sony a9.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

He&apos;s not a wedding photographer, but he did get the photos turned around and sent back to the client in one night. So he&apos;s putting us all to shame. We also talk with Aaron about his company Phlearn and the motivation behind teaching other photographers his craft.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been a crazy year but I think we can all agree that Black Widow is so much better than Hawkeye. Next up we talk about Dustin’s experiments with Facebook Live and his big switch to Sony. We also talk about Steve’s purchase of just one measly monopod over the Black Friday sales, and Steve’s new found love of Rogue Filters. Then we talk about the Canon Eos Rs that’s rumored to be announced in February as well as the Canon Eos hybrid mount camera rumor (that’s an EF/RF mount camera, so you can use your old lenses on a new body without an adaptor). Finally, we talk about how everyone needs to stop telling their friends to buy Sony gear. Talk up some crappy brands so that Sony has competition. We don’t want a monopoly. So tell your frenemies to go for a Fujifilm or Canon or Nikon or Panasonic this year and tell your enemies to go with Olympus.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;First up we’re talking about that new Black widow trailer before we get into Instagram Analytics and doctor visits. It’s been a crazy year but I think we can all agree that Black Widow is so much better than Hawkeye. Next up we talk about Dustin’s experiments with Facebook Live and his big switch to Sony. We also talk about Steve’s purchase of just one measly monopod over the Black Friday sales, and Steve’s new found love of Rogue Filters. Then we talk about the Canon Eos Rs that’s rumored to be announced in February as well as the Canon Eos hybrid mount camera rumor (that’s an EF/RF mount camera, so you can use your old lenses on a new body without an adaptor).

Have you heard of the iPhone that outshot a professional wedding photographer with some sort of DSLR or Mirrorless camera? Cause we&apos;re talking about that this week. We also talk about Steve&apos;s accident on the way to a wedding, Dustin&apos;s video woes, and the concept of having a minimum amount of money a client is required to book you for if they want to shoot on a Saturday or Sunday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

Anyway… While everyone else was out there learning, we were talking to a bunch of companies at the trade show. It was a weird and wild time. In our first episode we talk with Kodak, Image Salon, Sony, CG Pro Prints, HiDow, Photobooth Supply Co., and MagMod.</description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>
