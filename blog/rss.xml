She was using a Canon R5 to livestream her editing process in 8K. 15 minutes into the livestream she started sweating profusely. At 45 minutes into the livestream she stripped down to just a sports bra and yoga pants and began drinking lots of water. At one hour into the livestream she noted through her sweat that her camera and tripod had begun to glow read. Shortly after the camera began to sink and the HDMI cord leading from the camera to the computer seemed to catch fire moments before the livestream cut out. Concerned viewers called 911. A matter of minutes later the fire department arrived to find Jeannette emerging from a flame engulfed Airstream trailer with a glowing red R5 cradled lovingly between two oven mitts.</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

Mr. Rantz said he liked the photo and thought his client would too. When other group members ridiculed Mr. Rantz for not culling out what was obviously a mistake, Mr. Rantz claimed that the couple was out of focus on purpose and that the photo was in fact art. When pressed by other group members for comment on what exactly was the message of the art, Mr. Rantz replied that the photo resonates differently with everyone who views it and that’s part of what makes his art so striking. A cursory investigation of Mr. Rantz’s instagram account and website showed no other photos that shared a cohesive artistic expression consistent with the work posted in the Facebook group.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

Jeffrey Dunbar, a local Seattle photographer, has taken a hard stance for polygraphy. Dunbar claims photographers weren’t created to be married to one photograph and have that one photograph define their life. In a statement to the press Dunbar said, “I tell all of my photos that I will be taking many more photos. I don’t want any of them to be surprised when I go out the next day to satisfy my needs by taking another photo. There’s room in this relationship for as many photographs as will have me and I love each and every one of them.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>

Why? Because we’ve been paid to write a blog post and we love money. Anyway, now that we got that out of the way, let’s get down to business and talk about Basic Invite and their wedding photo guest book. Why is this worth talking about other than the fact that they’re paying us? Dustin and I are both professional wedding photographers. We’ve shot hundreds of weddings between the two of us. Basic Invite is by far the most used paper company that we deal with at weddings. It’s also our favorite company. When a client says they’re going with Basic Invite for their wedding stationery or guest book we breathe a sigh of relief because we know we won’t have to work to make it look good in photos. It will already look good.</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>
