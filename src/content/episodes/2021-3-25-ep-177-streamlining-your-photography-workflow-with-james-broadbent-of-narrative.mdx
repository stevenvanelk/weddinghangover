## Q&A:

Is Narrative Apple only and if so, when will it come to Windows?  
I don't like the idea of paying to keep blog posts on my site, but more importantly what is your favorite color?  
Can someone explain why photographers waste so much time culling photos? I shoot 100 and I deliver 100. What's the problem?  
I shoot family photos on burst mode and need a way to speed up post processing, what should I do?
