description: "This week Steve talks to James Broadbent of Narrative and Chasewild about building tools to help streamline workflows for photographers. They talk about Narrative Publish and Narrative Select and how they reduce the time it takes to publish blogs and also cull shoots. Steve and James also chat about Narrative's response to the Covid-19 Pandemic and how Narrative helped out their clients during the past year. Also they chat about how James got started in photography (with a 50mm in Pakistan taking photos of mountains during a trip) and about his destination photography company Chasewild."

This week Steve talks to James Broadbent of Narrative and Chasewild about building tools to help streamline workflows for photographers. They talk about Narrative Publish and Narrative Select and how they reduce the time it takes to publish blogs and also cull shoots. Steve and James also chat about Narrative's response to the Covid-19 Pandemic and how Narrative helped out their clients during the past year. Also they chat about how James got started in photography (with a 50mm in Pakistan taking photos of mountains during a trip) and about his destination photography company Chasewild.

## Q&A:
- Is Narrative Apple only and if so, when will it come to Windows?
- I don't like the idea of paying to keep blog posts on my site, but more importantly what is your favorite color?
- Can someone explain why photographers waste so much time culling photos? I shoot 100 and I deliver 100. What's the problem?
- I shoot family photos on burst mode and need a way to speed up post processing, what should I do?
