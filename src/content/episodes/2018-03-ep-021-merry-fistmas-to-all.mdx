## Beer Talk:
This week WPH is celebrating their holiday party:  
Dustin - Leinenkugel Snowdrift Vanilla Porter  
Steve - Revolution Fistmas. 

## Follow Up:
Steve is just complaining about ghost photos again.

## Topics:
Then we're on to talking about Christmas traditions and how to capture the kids on the holidays. Next up we talk about whether or not we send Christmas cards to clients.

## Q&A:
This week we have two questions from Iain from Steve's house. 
- Both about, spoiler alert, capturing photos of things that don't exist except in a young child's heart.
- Then we answer the question of whether or not it's a good idea to do a Christmas deal where you don't require a deposit to book a wedding.

## More Chat:
Also we have a parody song from Mr. Louis Novak about Net Neutrality set to the tune of American Pie. We don't have the time or energy to talk about that topic on this episode, but we wanted to spread a little Novak joy to everyone before Christmas.

## After Show:
Then Steve throws a curveball in the after show and asks Dustin to talk about whether or not he sends gifts to his clients for Christmas. They discuss that and whether or not it's beneficial from a marketing perspective before wrapping it up.
