description: Dustin and Steve talk about life as a wedding photographer when you have
  a child surprise in the middle of wedding season. Okay, not a child surprise. This
  isn't the Witcher... but an unexpected bundle of joy nonetheless. They also talk
  about how you should react if a client doesn't really want you at the wedding. As
  well as the pains of shooting a wedding video solo when things like card reading
  are brought up on the day of the wedding, moments before the ceremony as something
  the client wants to do before the ceremony. It's a tough week.

Dustin and Steve talk about life as a wedding photographer when you have a child surprise in the middle of wedding season. Okay, not a child surprise. This isn't the Witcher... but an unexpected bundle of joy nonetheless. They also talk about how you should react if a client doesn't really want you at the wedding. As well as the pains of shooting a wedding video solo when things like card reading are brought up on the day of the wedding, moments before the ceremony as something the client wants to do before the ceremony. It's a tough week.

## Beer Talk:

Steve - Fuity Nuggets X2 by 450 North Brewing Company  
Dustin - All Day IPA by Founders brewing Company

## Q&A:

Why do clients still ask to see examples of photographer's work when photographers post their work everywhere online?  
How long did you keep shooting weddings after getting pregnant? How long after childbirth till you started shooting again? How did you feel?  
What considerations do you need to make before having an associate shooter work for you?
