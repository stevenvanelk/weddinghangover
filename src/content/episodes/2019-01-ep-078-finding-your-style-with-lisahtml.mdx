## Q&A:  
- Is it ok to message a past client who got divorced and then engaged again to see if they want to use your as their photographer a second time?  
- Who’s fiscally responsible for an album ruined at a client meeting, the photographer or the client that ruined it?  
- Is it possible for your tongue to get stuck to a lens if it’s really cold outside?
