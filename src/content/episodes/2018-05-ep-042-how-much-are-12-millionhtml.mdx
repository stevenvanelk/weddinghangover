Steve commits to drinking 4 Strongbow Hard Ciders in the episode as a goof while Dustin is straight sipping a clear liquid. Then we’re on to follow up. We confront the inherent sexism in a question from the last episode of our podcast. Then we talk about one of our oldest bits of follow up on this podcast. That’s right, we talk about Steve flying his drone finally.

Then we push into the good stuff. Steve talks about a guy who was trying to sell his twitter account, which had 1.2 million followers. You'll never guess how much money he wanted for it. Then we talk about hotel accommodations for out of town guests. We get stuck here for a very long time because Steve cannot for the life of him understand Dustin's idea. Next up we talk about who should cover expenses incurred when you need another location. Once again we get hung up on this topic because Steve cannot fathom Dustin's terrible decisions. Finally we talk about when it's appropriate to give constructive criticism and how you should go about doing it.
