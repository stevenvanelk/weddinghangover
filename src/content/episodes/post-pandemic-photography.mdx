A lot of the way we do business is going to change as a direct result of the coronavirus and we want to help guide listeners through that. But also, what's the sexiest underwear a man could wear? Because that has merit for photographers too? Right? No?"

This week we're talking about getting back to work shooting photos after the pandemic. A lot of the way we do business is going to change as a direct result of the coronavirus and we want to help guide listeners through that. But also, what's the sexiest underwear a man could wear? Because that has merit for photographers too? Right? No?

## Beer Talk:  
Jenn - Busted Knuckle by Quaff ON! Brewery  
Steve - Stout by Glutenberg

## Q&A:  
How is the virus impacting our clients in ways we haven't thought about? Outside of just moving wedding dates or having less guests? Like, what if they're abstaining from sex till marriage and have to wait an extra year to start family planning as a result of this?  
What are your thoughts on those posts asking for location help in local photography groups?  
Can you tweak someone else's preset that you bought and then resell it to someone else?
