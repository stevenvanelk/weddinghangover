description: "We're talking vendors that try to do too much and Christmas gift ideas for photographers. Dustin's drinking a Budweiser while Steve is drinking either a Storm King or a Hop Lift... We didn't record that part this time so it's a little fuzzy. Questions from this recording are whether or not we use accountants for tax purposes and whether or not the apple watch is useful during events."

## Show Notes:
We're talking vendors that try to do too much and Christmas gift ideas for photographers. 

## Beer Talk:
Dustin's drinking a Budweiser  
Steve is drinking either a Storm King or a Hop Lift... We didn't record that part this time so it's a little fuzzy. 

## Q&A:
- Do we use accountants for tax purposes? 
- Is the apple watch is useful during events?

## Topics:
Also, we talk a lot about Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman... like surprising amount. So maybe hit up their wikipedia pages or something (we didn't). Wow... I really don't take the time to do the show notes right when I'm a day late on the upload... Sorry.
