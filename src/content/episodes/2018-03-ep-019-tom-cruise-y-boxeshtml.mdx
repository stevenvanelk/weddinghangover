description: "We're talking vendors that try to do too much and Christmas gift ideas for photographers. Dustin's drinking a Budweiser while Steve is drinking either a Storm King or a Hop Lift... We didn't record that part this time so it's a little fuzzy. Questions from this recording are whether or not we use accountants for tax purposes and whether or not the apple watch is useful during events."

We're talking vendors that try to do too much and Christmas gift ideas for photographers. Dustin's drinking a Budweiser while Steve is drinking either a Storm King or a Hop Lift... We didn't record that part this time so it's a little fuzzy. Questions from this recording are whether or not we use accountants for tax purposes and whether or not the apple watch is useful during events.

Also, we talk a lot about Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman... like surprising amount. So maybe hit up their wikipedia pages or something (we didn't). Wow... I really don't take the time to do the show notes right when I'm a day late on the upload... Sorry.

Those driving shoes Steve was talking about:
