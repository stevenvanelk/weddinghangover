description: "This week we’re joined by the crew from the I Don’t Give an F-Stop Podcast to talk about wedding photography, running small businesses, a little bit about their podcast and a lot about their relationships with each other. We talk a lot about styled shoots, the back end of producing a live video show that’s then turned into a podcast, working for Disney, what kind of man meat could make a girl break up with her boyfriend of 2 years at first sight, and some scary stuff like dealing with life threatening illnesses."
