description: This episode is weird. Dustin could have sent Steve his audio. Steve
  could have asked for that audio when he realized it wasn't there... but then Steve's
  massive frustration with Dustin's weird Skype glitches wouldn't shine through in
  the episode and then people would just think Steve and Dustin were frustrated for
  other reasons than technology... So here's that sweet Skype audio everyone craves
  so that you all know what horrors Steve and Dustin faced.

This episode is weird. Dustin could have sent Steve his audio. Steve could have asked for that audio when he realized it wasn't there... but then Steve's massive frustration with Dustin's weird Skype glitches wouldn't shine through in the episode and then people would just think Steve and Dustin were frustrated for other reasons than technology... So here's that sweet Skype audio everyone craves so that you all know what horrors Steve and Dustin faced.

This week we talk about the AirPods Max, Dustin's new fugly Kickstarter shoes (they're worse than moonshoes somehow), and people dying during or after shoots. It's a little bit morose but we promise to handle the topic with same level of tactless crassness that we always bring to the table. We also talk about people developing film in beer. Hell yeah! Finally we talk about the Sony Pony Droney (which we hold is a better name than AirPeak).

## Beer Talk:  
Steve - Eirik Bloodaxe (the best beer in the world) by Scarlet Lane Brewing  
Dustin - Fat Tire by New Belgium Brewing

## Q&A:  
WTF is the point of a photographer listing their gear or camera systems in their Instagram info, etc?  
What do you do if a wedding client is hiring different photographers for different parts of the day?  
Is it okay to edit noses and dorsal humps of your subjects without talking to them first to make sure it's something they want?
