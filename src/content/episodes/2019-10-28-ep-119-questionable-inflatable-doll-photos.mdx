We also have follow up about mattresses and using your Mac as a second display for your other Mac. Then, we're talking about Instagram at length. This episode is all about that toxic cess pool of social media. Stuck on Me is a movie with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. Also, a listener shares a messed up dream with us."

This week Dustin talks at length about a haunted house he went through. He's so courageous! We also have follow up about mattresses and using your Mac as a second display for your other Mac. Then, we're talking about Instagram at length. This episode is all about that toxic cess pool of social media. Stuck on Me is a movie with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. Also, a listener shares a messed up dream with us.

## Beer Talk:   
Steven - Dragon's Milk White from New Holland Brewery   
Dustin - Night Owl from Elysian Brewing Co.

## Q&A:
- Should you deliver photos with an inflatable doll in questionable positions to some prudes? 
- Does it annoy anyone when clients post cell phone photos from guests on their anniversary? 
- Do you prefer a slightly tighter crop or a wider crop?
