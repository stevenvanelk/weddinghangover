description: "How has the dismal vaccine rollout affected photographers? Some photographers have been kicked off Instagram since the insurrection on January 6th, is it related (it's not)? We're demanding to see location information to find out (we're terrible people and we're actually quite sorry for all of this). Sony a7iii impressions from shooting elopements and engagements. What a weird world it is to leave Canon for Sony. That weird Via Getty story from the insurrection. A daredevil photographer gets arrested for burglary. Lots of coronavirus talk and a few political things (we're not sorry about that... it's been a weird time period and we think it's important to talk about that kind of stuff... even if we're just making jokes). Sony Airpeak updates and sneak peeks. It's sexy (just like this show)."

How has the dismal vaccine rollout affected photographers? Some photographers have been kicked off Instagram since the insurrection on January 6th, is it related (it's not)? We're demanding to see location information to find out (we're terrible people and we're actually quite sorry for all of this). Sony a7iii impressions from shooting elopements and engagements. What a weird world it is to leave Canon for Sony. That weird Via Getty story from the insurrection. A daredevil photographer gets arrested for burglary. Lots of coronavirus talk and a few political things (we're not sorry about that... it's been a weird time period and we think it's important to talk about that kind of stuff... even if we're just making jokes).
