description: "Should you do a bridal show? What are some good bridal show hacks for vendors? What sort of expectations should you have going into a bridal show? Is Uncle Bob a worn out old term? What's the best location on a bridal show floor? Is it okay for a vendor to go to a bridal show as a guest and just spend time networking with other vendors, or should they stay away if they're not getting a booth? Do you give out cookies or candy to potential brides? If you're working a 9-5 and shooting on the side, and your employer asks you to do a photography shoot, how do you set boundaries so your employer doesn't take advantage of you and pay you less money than you're worth for your photography work?"
