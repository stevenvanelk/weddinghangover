description: Should you do a bridal show? What are some good bridal show hacks for
  vendors? What sort of expectations should you have going into a bridal show? Is
  Uncle Bob a worn out old term? What's the best location on a bridal show floor?
  Is it okay for a vendor to go to a bridal show as a guest and just spend time networking
  with other vendors, or should they stay away if they're not getting a booth? Do
  you give out cookies or candy to potential brides? If you're working a 9-5 and shooting
  on the side, and your employer asks you to do a photography shoot, how do you set
  boundaries so your employer doesn't take advantage of you and pay you less money
  than you're worth for your photography work?

Should you do a bridal show? What are some good bridal show hacks for vendors? What sort of expectations should you have going into a bridal show? Is Uncle Bob a worn out old term? What's the best location on a bridal show floor? Is it okay for a vendor to go to a bridal show as a guest and just spend time networking with other vendors, or should they stay away if they're not getting a booth? Do you give out cookies or candy to potential brides? If you're working a 9-5 and shooting on the side, and your employer asks you to do a photography shoot, how do you set boundaries so your employer doesn't take advantage of you and pay you less money than you're worth for your photography work?

Come back next week when we have wedding photographer and podcaster Nathan Mitchell on the show.
