In our very special Easter episode of the podcast, Steve and Dustin are talking about spring mini sessions, the Easter Bunny's upcoming marriage to Santa Claus, a furry wedding video, and whether or not you should allow children to hold bunnies and/or chicks during a mini session. Also, Dustin talks about shooting brides with horses.

Now it's time for some questions: How do I tell a client to back off? If I'm hopping (pun intended) to do some Easter pictures, does anyone have an ideas or suggestions? Is Easter Sunday OK for a wedding? What would you think of an easter-themed wedding (groom dressed as a bunny, bride as a chick)? How are pretzels linked to Easter and wedding traditions?
