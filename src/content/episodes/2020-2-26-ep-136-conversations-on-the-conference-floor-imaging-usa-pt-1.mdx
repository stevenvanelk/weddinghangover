description: "Here's part 1 of our two part episode from the Imaging USA conference. Steve lost his voice on the way to Imaging USA… so that was great. As a result he sounds a little like a middle school student. So you’ll all have to rely on Dustin to bring those sweet tones you’ve grown used to enjoying in your earholes. Anyway… While everyone else was out there learning, we were talking to a bunch of companies at the trade show. It was a weird and wild time. In our first episode we talk with Kodak, Image Salon, Sony, CG Pro Prints, HiDow, Photobooth Supply Co., and MagMod."

Here's part 1 of our two part episode from the Imaging USA conference. Steve lost his voice on the way to Imaging USA… so that was great. As a result he sounds a little like a middle school student. So you’ll all have to rely on Dustin to bring those sweet tones you’ve grown used to enjoying in your earholes. Anyway… While everyone else was out there learning, we were talking to a bunch of companies at the trade show. It was a weird and wild time. In our first episode we talk with [Kodak](https://www.kodak.com/), [Image Salon](https://imagesalon.com/), [Sony](https://www.sony.com/electronics/cameras), [CG Pro Prints](https://www.cgproprints.com/), [HiDow](https://www.hidow.com/), [Photobooth Supply Co.](https://photoboothsupplyco.com/), and [MagMod](https://magnetmod.com/).
