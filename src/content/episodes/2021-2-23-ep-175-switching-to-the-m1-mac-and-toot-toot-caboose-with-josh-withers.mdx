description: "This week we talk with Josh Withers about his switch from editing photos on the iPad Pro to a new M1 MacBook. We also talk about some crazy theory about the right way to pose men and women in photos that's some weird toxic masculinity crap, using your Facebook group to charge vendors to post, and looking for a way to get a venue for 500 people that has a 100% refundable deposit and also is available in three months."

This week we talk with Josh Withers about his switch from editing photos on the iPad Pro to a new M1 MacBook. We also talk about some crazy theory about the right way to pose men and women in photos that's some weird toxic masculinity crap, using your Facebook group to charge vendors to post, and looking for a way to get a venue for 500 people that has a 100% refundable deposit and also is available in three months.

## Q&A:
- Has anyone been shooting in the pandemic?
- Has anyone been put into any interesting situations because of Covid?
- What considerations do you need to keep in mind for associate photographers if it's your first time using one?
