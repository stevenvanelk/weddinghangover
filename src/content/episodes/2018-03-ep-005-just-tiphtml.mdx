description: In this episode, Dustin plays just the tip with his Voodoo Ranger Atomic
  Pumpkin Ale while Steve drinks a delicious St. Bernardus Tripel bought for him as
  a gift. Then, Steve promotes the podcast, in the podcast. It's podcast inception.
  Dustin and Steve discuss their non-existent political futures. Then it's on to the
  good stuff. Dustin talks about his backup plan since he just went through what he
  calls the super bowl of wedding weekends (Labor Day Weekend) where he shot three
  weddings. Then Steve goes on a rant about the misuse of drones in photography and
  videography, especially in wedding photography and videography. Dustin gets around
  to talking about another Kickstarter product that he still hasn't received. It's
  called GearEye and Dustin refers to it as a Tile competitor. Steve shares an embarrassing
  story about misunderstanding song lyrics. Then Dustin talks about another product
  he 'invested' in and never received called loop. It's a product for people without
  smartphones or tablets.
