This week we talked with Jamie Findlay of Evolve Workshops. Jamie talked to us about being a photographer in Idaho as well as running international photography workshops. We talked about her transition from running a clothing store to shooting photos. We also talked about the impetus for starting Evolve Workshops and how it evolved from simple meetups to international workshops and an annual conference.

## Q&A:
- Should you ever stop someone teaching a workshop to correct them and educate the attendees?
- Should you go to Iceland for a food photography workshop?
- Is it okay to put on a workshop where you just teach everything you learned at someone else's workshop?
- How much working and how much shopping should you plan to do at a photography workshop?
