A photographer in Wisconsin who lost their gear, get it all back... with the wedding photos still on the cards (after running recovery software). A multi-year winner of the Knot's 'Best of Weddings' award is sued by a bunch of clients and the media thinks this is a big deal. We learn about the beauty of death and see brainstorm how we can incorporate that into our weddings. DJI puts out a new Osmo pocket thing for cell phones."

Spider-Man is out of the MCU. A photographer loses photos in a house fire. A photographer in Wisconsin who lost their gear, get it all back... with the wedding photos still on the cards (after running recovery software). A multi-year winner of the Knot's "Best of Weddings" award is sued by a bunch of clients and the media thinks this is a big deal. We learn about the beauty of death and see brainstorm how we can incorporate that into our weddings. DJI puts out a new Osmo pocket thing for cell phones.
