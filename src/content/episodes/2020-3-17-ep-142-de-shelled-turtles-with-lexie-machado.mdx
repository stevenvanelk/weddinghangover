This week we talked with Lexie Machado of The Awkward Photog - Alexa Machado Photography. We talk with Lexie about celery juicing, photoshopping portraits, using selective coloring in your editing workflow, and about building an educational platform for photographers. We also talk about de-shelled turtle backgrounds, photoshopping blankets out from under kids, the ethics of drawing or dropping someone into a photo, and what exactly Lightroom do and what it different from photoshop.

Check out some of Lexie’s fantastical portrait work (link to her website below).
