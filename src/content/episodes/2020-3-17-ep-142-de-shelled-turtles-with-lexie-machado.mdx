description: This week we talked with Lexie Machado of The Awkward Photog - Alexa
  Machado Photography. We talk with Lexie about celery juicing, photoshopping portraits,
  using selective coloring in your editing workflow, and about building an educational
  platform for photographers. We also talk about de-shelled turtle backgrounds, photoshopping
  blankets out from under kids, the ethics of drawing or dropping someone into a photo,
  and what exactly Lightroom do and what it different from photoshop.
