We talk with Lexie about celery juicing, photoshopping portraits, using selective coloring in your editing workflow, and about building an educational platform for photographers. We also talk about de-shelled turtle backgrounds, photoshopping blankets out from under kids, the ethics of drawing or dropping someone into a photo, and what exactly Lightroom do and what it different from photoshop."
