This is one of our most reference heavy episodes to date, so hold on to your butts.

Dustin used the power of his negative energy to ruin Steve's weekend. That's right, Dustin's bad karma rubbed off on Steve causing Steve to have to shoot a wedding. You wouldn't have thought it was possible, but apparently it was.

Follow Up: Dustin’s copyright situation. We all assumed his lawyer wouldn't want him to keep talking about it, but apparently his lawyer doesn't care. Then Dustin fills us in on what happened at the military reunion. Finally we circle back around to the subject of Movie Pass. It's dying.

## Beer Talk:  
Steve's drinking a Scarlet Lane Dorian Stout while Dustin is stuck on that H2O.

Topics:  
Horrendous hipster trends.   
[Nikon’s lens mount teaser](https://petapixel.com/2018/08/02/nikons-latest-teaser-for-its-full-frame-mirrorless-reveals-the-lens-mount/).  
[Best Buy photo workshops](https://petapixel.com/2018/08/01/best-buy-has-photography-workshops-now/).  
[Mavic Pro 2 announcement](https://dronelife.com/2018/07/31/uk-retailer-new-dji-mavic-2-before-official-release/) that shouldn’t have existed.

Finally we get into a legit topic instead of just discussing the news. Have either one of us shot a wedding hungover? The answer will surprise you.

## Q&A:  
What about associate photographers? How much do you pay them?  
What if you’re sick on a wedding day? That freaks us out!  
On-camera or off-camera flash? Do you go for convenience or do you work to get those good looking pics?

At the end Dustin talks about Madame Secretary while Steve focuses on something good. That good thing is the Scriptnotes podcast. It's one of Steve's favorites, but that's because he has an endless fascination with screenwriting.
