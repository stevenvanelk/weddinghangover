Should Petapixel allow their writers use their enormous platform to go after thieves that no one has ever heard of, thus giving them more attention than they ever could have hoped to receive in the first place?

How can you make a move on a client who's getting married soon, without jeopardizing your business? Should Petapixel allow their writers use their enormous platform to go after thieves that no one has ever heard of, thus giving them more attention than they ever could have hoped to receive in the first place? Is it a thing that non-profits can't pay for shoots? What do you do when the conversations with the bridesmaids or groomsmen get uncomfortable? We haven't even gotten to listener Q&A and random facebook questions yet.

## Beer Talk:
Dustin - Taxman Cherry Wit-Held

Steve - Upland Wheat Ale

## Q&A:
