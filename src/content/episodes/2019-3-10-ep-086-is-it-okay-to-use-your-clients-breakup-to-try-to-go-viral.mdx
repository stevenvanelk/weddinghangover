description: "This week Dustin and Steve experienced a lot of weird energy… So they’re trying to combat it in their durndest by putting out the most gosh gilly wash innocent and fun podcast you’ve heard! They received a strange recommendation on a photo educator’s website. The recommendation seemed to be more concerned with throwing shade at other photography podcasts without mentioning what those podcasts were… It was weird, but we’re still glad to have been on that list of recommended podcasts! Someone put Dustin on a Republican email list and that listener has made Steve the happiest boy alive."
