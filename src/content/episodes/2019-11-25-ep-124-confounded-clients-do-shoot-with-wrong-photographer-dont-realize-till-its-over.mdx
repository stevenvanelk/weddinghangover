description: Santa Sessions, the impending Thanksgiving holiday in the US, part 107
  study sessions, and software for your cloud client are how we start this episode.
  Then we’re talking about guerrilla marketing, storage solutions, Olympus getting
  out of the camera game, and things that Instagram is testing on US users right now.
  Also, we talk about drones and privacy and Dustin surprisingly drops some drone
  knowledge from his studies.

Santa Sessions, the impending Thanksgiving holiday in the US, part 107 study sessions, and software for your cloud client are how we start this episode.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Cherry Wit-Held from Taxman Brewing Co.  
Steven - Build-A-Beer from Taxman Brewing Co. and Glutenberg’s IPA

## Q&A:  
What do you do if your client accidentally gets photos from another photographer during your session time?  
Do you feel like in another universe if you didn’t work weddings that you’d be able to be an Ed Sheehan fan?  
Should you create separate websites and brands for each niche of photography that you want to do? Or is it better to show you do more than just weddings?
