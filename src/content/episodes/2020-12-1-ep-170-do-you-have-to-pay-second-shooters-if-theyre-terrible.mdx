description: "This week we're going hard in the paint on Q&A. We talk about treatment and pay of second shooters, whether it's okay to call other photographers out when they lie, if you should tell other photographers not to buy DSLRs, whether or not you should have in-laws in family photos, and if you should plan elopements for people before they officially hire you. In the post show we talk about 30 Rock, Neil Gaiman's American Gods, Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series and the Stormlight Archive series, and also  the Harley Quinn series. It's a book heavy post show... well, audiobooks (our biggest competitor... why are we doing this?)."

This week we're going hard in the paint on ## Q&A:. We talk about treatment and pay of second shooters, whether it's okay to call other photographers out when they lie, if you should tell other photographers not to buy DSLRs, whether or not you should have in-laws in family photos, and if you should plan elopements for people before they officially hire you. In the post show we talk about 30 Rock, Neil Gaiman's American Gods, Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series and the Stormlight Archive series, and also  the Harley Quinn series. It's a book heavy post show... well, audiobooks (our biggest competitor... why are we doing this?).
