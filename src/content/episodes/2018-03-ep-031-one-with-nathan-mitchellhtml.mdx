description: "This week we invited photographer and podcaster Nathan Mitchell onto the show to talk about how he got started shooting weddings, why he thinks it's beneficial to second shoot, running Instagram advertising campaigns, and his band Prisms. We touch on a lot of other stuff too and Nathan gives some great, practical advice for photographers. Plus, Nathan tells us about the first wedding he shot... when he was traveling in India. We also play some Star Wars trivia and answer some questions from the internet about whether or not you should narc on a guest that's breaking the venue's rules, whether or not an inexperienced photographer should shoot a friend's wedding, and what to do if you see something you shouldn't at a wedding (which we're pretty certain was joke question, but we included it anyway)."

## Show Notes:
This week we invited photographer and podcaster Nathan Mitchell onto the show to talk about how he got started shooting weddings, why he thinks it's beneficial to second shoot, running Instagram advertising campaigns, and his band Prisms. We touch on a lot of other stuff too and Nathan gives some great, practical advice for photographers. Plus, Nathan tells us about the first wedding he shot... when he was traveling in India. We also play some Star Wars trivia and answer some questions from the internet.

## Q&A:
- Should you narc on a guest that's breaking the venue's rules?
- Should an inexperienced photographer should shoot a friend's wedding? 
- What should you do if you see something you shouldn't at a wedding (which we're pretty certain was joke question, but we included it anyway)?
