description: This week we invited photographer and podcaster Nathan Mitchell onto
  the show to talk about how he got started shooting weddings, why he thinks it's
  beneficial to second shoot, running Instagram advertising campaigns, and his band
  Prisms. We touch on a lot of other stuff too and Nathan gives some great, practical
  advice for photographers. Plus, Nathan tells us about the first wedding he shot...
  when he was traveling in India. We also play some Star Wars trivia and answer some
  questions from the internet about whether or not you should narc on a guest that's
  breaking the venue's rules, whether or not an inexperienced photographer should
  shoot a friend's wedding, and what to do if you see something you shouldn't at a
  wedding (which we're pretty certain was joke question, but we included it anyway).
