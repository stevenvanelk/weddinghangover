description: "This episode has a few rants. We put a musical bed underneath them to make them a little more palatable for people who don’t like rants… but if you don’t like angry rants then you probably quit this show a long time ago. So, we’re both a little angry this week and flying off the handle. But it’s for a good cause. We just think photographers deserve to be treated well, and one of us especially thinks that photographers need to treat other photographers well. But before we get to those rants, we gotta talk about this new post-wedding fad. It’s called Mr. Rogering. It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Won’t you be our neighbors?"

This episode has a few rants. We put a musical bed underneath them to make them a little more palatable for people who don’t like rants… but if you don’t like angry rants then you probably quit this show a long time ago. So, we’re both a little angry this week and flying off the handle. But it’s for a good cause. We just think photographers deserve to be treated well, and one of us especially thinks that photographers need to treat other photographers well. But before we get to those rants, we gotta talk about this new post-wedding fad. It’s called Mr. Rogering. It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Won’t you be our neighbors?
