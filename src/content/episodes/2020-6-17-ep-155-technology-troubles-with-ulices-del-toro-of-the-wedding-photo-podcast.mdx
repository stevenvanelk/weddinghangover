description: This week Steve forgets about Dustin. Literally, Steve forgot that Dustin
  was going to be out of town and had to rope Ulices Del Toro in for an emergency
  guest host spot... And it goes terribly. Mired in the muck of technology trouble
  Steve and Ulices barely manage to record an episode. It's all Steve's fault as his
  computer and Skype seem to just be failing him left and right. In this episode Steve
  and Ulices talk about a photographer who was shot in the face, an image that bricked
  a bunch of Android phones, Ulices's time working for Kim Kardashian's publicity
  team, and some other technology that Steve is breaking, specifically his Apple Watch.
  Also, Steve and Jenn are switching to PicTime and we start discussing that.

This week Steve forgets about Dustin. Literally, Steve forgot that Dustin was going to be out of town and had to rope Ulices Del Toro in for an emergency guest host spot... And it goes terribly. Mired in the muck of technology trouble Steve and Ulices barely manage to record an episode. It's all Steve's fault as his computer and Skype seem to just be failing him left and right. In this episode Steve and Ulices talk about a photographer who was shot in the face, an image that bricked a bunch of Android phones, Ulices's time working for Kim Kardashian's publicity team, and some other technology that Steve is breaking, specifically his Apple Watch.

## Beer Talk:  
Ulices - Lil' Squeezy Juicy Ale from Deschutes Brewery  
Steve - Enjoy by 07.04.20 by Stone Brewing

## Q&A:  
What percentage of horizontal images do you shoot?  
If no one shows up to the event before my stated end time, can I ask the caterers if I can take some food home?  
How can I keep from losing fans when I post LGBTQ weddings to my Instagram? (get fans that aren't terrible?)
