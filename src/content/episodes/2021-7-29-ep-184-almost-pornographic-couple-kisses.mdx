Dustin and Steve are easing back into the new world of post-covid-vaccine weddings. Dustin is busy with real estate. Steve is trying out new straps for his cameras. Corny puns. Slippery nips. HBO Max. Steve drops big news and then even bigger news to end the episode.

## Beer Talk:  
Steve - Bourbon Barrel No Sparge Imperial Golden Ale from Taxman Brewing Co.  
Dustin - Soft Parade by Short's Brewing Company

## Q&A:  
What do you do if you live with someone who gets covid, but you're still testing negative? Do you call off your shoots anyway?  
Is anyone still on clubhouse?  
Do you cater to guests who ask for photos of themselves 3 days after a wedding?  
Have you ever had a couple go at it when you ask them to kiss? Like, really go at it?
