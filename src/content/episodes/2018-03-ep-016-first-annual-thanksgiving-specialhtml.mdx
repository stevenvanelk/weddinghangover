It's a family friendly holiday event, assuming your family knows is comfortable with talk of aubergine photos. Next up we discuss what we're looking forward to buying come Black Friday. Dustin's all about those B&H deals. Those are discoverable at www.bhphotovideo.com"

## Show Notes:
It's our first annual Thanksgiving episode! In this special episode, Dustin and Steve talk about the ways we are blessed and then give thanks. It's a family friendly holiday event, assuming your family knows is comfortable with talk of aubergine photos. Next up we discuss what we're looking forward to buying come Black Friday. Dustin's all about those B&H deals. Those are discoverable at [www.bhphotovideo.com](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/)

Then finally we answer the most inane question Steve has found yet. It's photo related, and it's about the first Thanksgiving... That's probably giving too much away. Then it's all over folks, but we'll be back on Sunday with a regular episode (which will also feature Dustin's less than stellar audio... and this after his jokes about Steve's audio in episodes 2 & 3).
