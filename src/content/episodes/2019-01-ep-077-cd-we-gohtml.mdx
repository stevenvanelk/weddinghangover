We actually spend most of the episode talking about photography and specifically wedding photography, but we have a tiny tangent at the beginning."

Steve and Dustin are still sick. Which means they're talking mattresses! What fun! There's a lot of talk about Casper, Purple, and GhostBed mattresses in this episode. We actually spend most of the episode talking about photography and specifically wedding photography, but we have a tiny tangent at the beginning.
