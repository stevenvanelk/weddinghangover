description: "This week we’re joined by the world’s greatest photographers, Booray Perry and Gary Hughes, of the Photobomb Podcast! It’s a claim that the intro to their podcast makes every week… and I guess now we’ve made about them too. We’re talking about Comic books, Dungeons and Dragons, parenting, podcasting, the PPA (Professional Photographers of America) and a little bit about actual photography at some point too!"

This week we’re joined by the world’s greatest photographers, Booray Perry and Gary Hughes, of the Photobomb Podcast! It’s a claim that the intro to their podcast makes every week… and I guess now we’ve made about them too. We’re talking about Comic books, Dungeons and Dragons, parenting, podcasting, the PPA (Professional Photographers of America) and a little bit about actual photography at some point too!

## Q&A:
- Can you wash a lens wipe if someone spit on it? 
- How can you get information about a sick kid whose sucker you at off the floor? 
- If you’re doing a drip coffee shoot with a model, how hot is too hot for the coffee you’re going to pour on the model? 
- What are some names for a photography company that’ll bring in less emails that are gross than my current name, B.J. Photography?
