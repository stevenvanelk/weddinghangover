description: "In the last episode of the podcast Dustin spent a very long time complaining about the drone footage from a recent wedding he shot. He complained a lot about the visuals from the drone. That unfortunately doesn't translate very well to an audio podcast. So, we've gone ahead and decided to upload the footage from the drone. It's only a little over 2 minutes long. It's not a good representation of Dustin's work or his brand/style. So without further adieu, here it is:"

That unfortunately doesn't translate very well to an audio podcast. So, we've gone ahead and decided to upload the footage from the drone. It's only a little over 2 minutes long.

Also, I went back and added the footage to the last post with the embedded episode of the podcast. Since most people don't look at the non-podcast episode blog posts, I thought that would work out better. So, if you're one of the few people who look at both, sorry for showing you a video you already saw in a different blog post.

We'll be back this upcoming Sunday with a new episode of the podcast. See you all then!
