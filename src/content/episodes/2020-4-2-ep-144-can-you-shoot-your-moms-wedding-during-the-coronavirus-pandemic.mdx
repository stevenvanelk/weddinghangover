description: "This week we’re talking about the Boston photographer that unwittingly spread COVID-19 to a bunch of clients, family, and friends after contracting the disease at a biogenesis conference. We also talk about a wedding photographer whose social media was hacked at the beginning of the global pandemic causing a lot of stress for her and her clients and after that we talk about a photographer that threatened to delete a problematic client’s photos. We also take a trip to the drone zone to talk about a new drone that can play dodgeball."

This week we’re talking about the Boston photographer that unwittingly spread COVID-19 to a bunch of clients, family, and friends after contracting the disease at a biogenesis conference. We also talk about a wedding photographer whose social media was hacked at the beginning of the global pandemic causing a lot of stress for her and her clients and after that we talk about a photographer that threatened to delete a problematic client’s photos. We also take a trip to the drone zone to talk about a new drone that can play dodgeball.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Puppy Slumber Party from Metazoa  
Steve - Double Dorian Stout from Scarlet Lane

## Q&A:
- Should you shoot your mom’s wedding she’s refusing to cancel due to the pandemic when she’s not paying you anyway or signing a contract?
- Anybody printing at home during the pandemic instead of having their prints done by a lab?
- How often do you feel like bludgeoning the celebrant with your camera?
- What do you do when you’re friends with the bride and she updates her facebook to say she’s in a relationship with a man who is not her soon-to-be groom?
- Can you shoot a proposal at a park when your state has a stay at home mandate?
- Does anyone offer more things to bring in extra income?
