description: This week we’re talking about the Boston photographer that unwittingly
  spread COVID-19 to a bunch of clients, family, and friends after contracting the
  disease at a biogenesis conference. We also talk about a wedding photographer whose
  social media was hacked at the beginning of the global pandemic causing a lot of
  stress for her and her clients and after that we talk about a photographer that
  threatened to delete a problematic client’s photos. We also take a trip to the drone
  zone to talk about a new drone that can play dodgeball.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Puppy Slumber Party from Metazoa  
Steve - Double Dorian Stout from Scarlet Lane

## Q&A:  
Should you shoot your mom’s wedding she’s refusing to cancel due to the pandemic when she’s not paying you anyway or signing a contract?  
Anybody printing at home during the pandemic instead of having their prints done by a lab?  
How often do you feel like bludgeoning the celebrant with your camera?  
What do you do when you’re friends with the bride and she updates her facebook to say she’s in a relationship with a man who is not her soon-to-be groom?  
Can you shoot a proposal at a park when your state has a stay at home mandate?  
Does anyone offer more things to bring in extra income?
