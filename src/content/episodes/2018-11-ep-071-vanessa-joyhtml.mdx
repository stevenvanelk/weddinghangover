This week we’re talking to Vanessa Joy about sunset shots, wide angle shots, profoto, melting pocket wizards, fashion for photographers and footwear for photographers, speed posing and that something that happens at every wedding.

## Q&A:
- What do you do for albums?
- How can a short person capture tall people without breaking their back lugging a step ladder around?
- What should a natural light photographer with no intention of using flash do on a rainy day?
