description: "This episode we discuss the highly problematic film Wedding Crashers with Morgan Roberts and Dominic Fitzgerald of the Down Down Critics are Down podcast! Buckle up, because this episode is a little bit messy. Also one of the crew this week admits something ridiculously miraculous... they've never been to a wedding. A wedding virgin watched Wedding Crashers... it's so weird."

This episode we discuss the highly problematic film Wedding Crashers with Morgan Roberts and Dominic Fitzgerald of the Down Down Critics are Down podcast! Buckle up, because this episode is a little bit messy. Also one of the crew this week admits something ridiculously miraculous... they've never been to a wedding. A wedding virgin watched Wedding Crashers... it's so weird.

## Beer Talk:  
Morgan - Zesty Pale Ale by Zytho Brewing  
Steve - IPA from Wild Range Brewing Company

Apologies for the audio not being up to par with a typical episode. We had some recording issues and thus had to fall back to using the audio from the Skype call.
