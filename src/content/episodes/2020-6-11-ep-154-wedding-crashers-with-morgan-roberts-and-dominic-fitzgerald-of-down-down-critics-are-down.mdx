This episode we discuss the highly problematic film Wedding Crashers with Morgan Roberts and Dominic Fitzgerald of the Down Down Critics are Down podcast! Buckle up, because this episode is a little bit messy. Also one of the crew this week admits something ridiculously miraculous... they've never been to a wedding. A wedding virgin watched Wedding Crashers... it's so weird.

## Beer Talk:  
Morgan - Zesty Pale Ale by Zytho Brewing  
Steve - IPA from Wild Range Brewing Company

Apologies for the audio not being up to par with a typical episode. We had some recording issues and thus had to fall back to using the audio from the Skype call.
