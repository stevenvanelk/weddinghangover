description: "In this episode Dustin and Steve talk about whether or not they drink alcohol while shooting weddings and also whether or not they drink caffeine during weddings. They also try to talk about the differences between Canon and Nikon and Sony, but they recorded on a Saturday night after drinking some alcohol so they get pretty derailed talking about Dustin's Dilemma with backing the Coolest Cooler on Kickstarter. Also, they go on a random tangent about Steve's waking night terrors and whether or not Bruce Wayne or Batman would be interested in using children's tears to prolong their life."

## Show Notes:
In this episode Dustin and Steve talk about whether or not they drink alcohol while shooting weddings and also whether or not they drink caffeine during weddings. They also try to talk about the differences between Canon and Nikon and Sony, but they recorded on a Saturday night after drinking some alcohol. So, they get pretty derailed talking about Dustin's Dilemma with backing the Coolest Cooler on Kickstarter instead of staying on topic.  

Also, they go on a random tangent about Steve's waking night terrors and whether or not Bruce Wayne or Batman would be interested in using children's tears to prolong their life.
