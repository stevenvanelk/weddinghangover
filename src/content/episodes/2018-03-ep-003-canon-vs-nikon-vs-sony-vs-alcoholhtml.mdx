description: In this episode Dustin and Steve talk about whether or not they drink
  alcohol while shooting weddings and also whether or not they drink caffeine during
  weddings. They also try to talk about the differences between Canon and Nikon and
  Sony, but they recorded on a Saturday night after drinking some alcohol so they
  get pretty derailed talking about Dustin's Dilemma with backing the Coolest Cooler
  on Kickstarter. Also, they go on a random tangent about Steve's waking night terrors
  and whether or not Bruce Wayne or Batman would be interested in using children's
  tears to prolong their life.
