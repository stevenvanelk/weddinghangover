Follow Up:

Did Dustin get his [Mavic 2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GDC5X74/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GDC5X74&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=a5422f593dfedeff8f015e2853f03e80) yet? If not, what happened to it?

We're back on those Cole Haans again, because they've put out a new shoe that doesn't look like a moonshoe... and Dustin bought a pair.

Everyone loves Dustin's smokebomb shot (pictured above), including Steve (surprisingly).

## Beer Talk:

Steve's drinking a Bell's Two Hearted. One of the best beers from the midwest that's readily available pretty much all over the US (at least every liquor store he's been inside).

Dustin's drinking white wine from a local winery in the Fort Wayne area called Two EEs.

Topics:
