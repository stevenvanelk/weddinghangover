This week we're talking about underwater and in the air drones, what parts of the wedding day are and aren't important, and how to sell yourself to prospective clients. We also talk about the best ways to proselytize the podcast thanks to a listener question, but not in Q&A.

We've got follow up on a question about a client posting filtered photos as well.

## Beer Talk:

Dustin - Water

Steve - Samuel Adams Bavarian Lager

## Q&A:
- How long do you give a bride to secure a date?
- How do you keep a couple from stringing you along like a lovesick teenager?
- Do you just bounce out of weddings?

Want to read that article about the couple upset with their wedding photographer in what is definitely a Great Plains state? [Here you go](https://www.wowt.com/content/news/Newlyweds-experience-long-wait-for-wedding-photos-504029681.html)!

If you want to visit Dustin or Steve’s about me page, you can find them both living on the “[About](https://weddinghangover.com/why/)” page of this website now.
