## Beer Talk:  
Raymond - Super Cluster Ale from Lagunitas Brewing Company  
Steve - Oktoberfest from Upland Brewing Co.  
Dustin - Water

## Q&A:  
Should you leave your Sony a7 1DX Mark III in the box or use it? Which way is it more valuable?  
How can I make sure I capture the wedding and keep my wits about me to get some photos of a Sasquatch when I'm in Bigfoot country?  
How can you get your beer in the photos and your photos in the beer when documenting the home brewing experience, without ruining a GoPro while boiling the wort?  
Siri, How drunk isshto drunf when shooting a weeeeeeeeeedin?
