description: "First up we talk some more about email marketing. Then we talk about Facebook Live marketing and Instagram Story marketing. Dustin and Ulices talk a little bit about making the change to Sony. Dustin shares about shooting his first professional photo jobs completely with his Sony gear. Nikon shuts down their authorized repair program, a bride is arrested for allegedly forcing a photographer to pay to shoot her wedding, and a Kentucky photographer sues for her supposed religious right to discriminate against people (BTW, there's no religious right that allows anyone to discriminate)."

First up we talk some more about email marketing. Then we talk about Facebook Live marketing and Instagram Story marketing. Dustin and Ulices talk a little bit about making the change to Sony. Dustin shares about shooting his first professional photo jobs completely with his Sony gear. Nikon shuts down their authorized repair program, a bride is arrested for allegedly forcing a photographer to pay to shoot her wedding, and a Kentucky photographer sues for her supposed religious right to discriminate against people (BTW, there's no religious right that allows anyone to discriminate).

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - InvEster by Taxman Brewing Co.  
Steve - Hazy Jane IPA by Brewdog  
Ulices - Meat and Potatoes Dinner Stout by Lord Hobo Brewing Co., Old Fashioned by Anderson Valley, and Hopnaut by Great Divide

## Q&A:
- Should I dump my boyfriend if he isn't willing to pay for photos at the same rate that I charge my clients?
- Where's the line with skin retouching? How much is too much?
- Does anyone else deliver photos of Uncle Bobs at weddings with their galleries
