This week we were joined by Meredith Ryncarz of Meredith Ryncarz Photography and the Restart Specialist! Those are both websites and YouTube channels full of educational content for photographers. If you’re not familiar with either of those, then you may have seen her work in Forbes, Southern Living, Tidewater and Tulle, Southern Weddings, Bokeh and Aisle Planner.

## Beer Talk:  
Meredith - Johnnie Walker Blue Label  
Dustin -  Pool Time Ale from Bell's Brewery  
Steve - The CPA (creamy peach ale) from Taxman Brewing Company

## Q&A:
- Is there a good way to let another photographer know they're overexposing their photos?
- How do you let a bride know you're not her planner/coordinator?
- If you accidentally edit a baby photo to look like a Twilight vampire, do you stick with it or change things up?
