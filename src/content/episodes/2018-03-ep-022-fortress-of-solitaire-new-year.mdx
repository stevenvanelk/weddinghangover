description: "New Year's resolutions for photographers and small business owners. Learning to fly. James Cameron movies. Bedazzled jackets and whoopee cushion marketing. Spending all your money before the end of the year on new camera gear. How to get those baby new year photos of the first baby born in your area. Also, Steve was drinking an Alpha Klaus from Three Floyds and Dustin was drinking a clear liquid again."
