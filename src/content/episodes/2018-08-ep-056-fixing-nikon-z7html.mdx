Steve's drinking a Flat 12 Pogue's Run Porter, again. Dustin's not drinking, again... But apparently he had a lot of vodka cranberries right before we recorded.

Dustin tells a story about smoke bombs. Then we talk about a dilemma with the Knot. After that we transition into the Drone Zone to talk about the new [DJI Mavic 2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GDC5X74/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GDC5X74&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=a5422f593dfedeff8f015e2853f03e80) and [DJI Mavic 2 Zoom](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD9XY6J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GD9XY6J&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=dc28e168131d487e353bcee5b2b8ac6c). One of us has already pre-ordered the Pro. Then we talk about the new Nikon Z6 and Z7. A lot of photographers seem to be upset about it because it doesn't live up to their expectations, so Steve lays out a plan to fix the [Nikon Z7](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GQ3HVW1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GQ3HVW1&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=deb7922c4ec757e7299da7a37f4caaa5). It all applicable to the [Nikon Z6](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GPH7M5X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07GPH7M5X&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=b63c2f5189399319218a41fabd500145) too. Then we briefly mention the Carl Zeiss fixed lens camera that was teased on the same day that DJI and Nikon announced their big news. After that we talk about the idea of a wedding tax because of a post we read on Reddit (link below).

Then it's on to some QA
