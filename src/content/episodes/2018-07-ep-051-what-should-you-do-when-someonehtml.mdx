We start talking about the joy of having a week off and going on vacation, then do some follow up on some of the kickstarter stuff Dustin has "bought." 

## Beer Talk:
Steve's drinking an Olga from Scarlet Lane while  
Dustin's drinking a Michelob Ultra Lime and Cactus.

## Topics:
Dustin finds out someone violated his copyright. We talk about watermarks and what to do if someone crops your watermark out of a photo. Then we talk about our night before a wedding rituals.

## Q&A:
- Why do clients try to take advantage of you and ask for more time without wanting to pay? 
- What should you do if a client posts they're splitting up before you deliver the photos? 
- What's in your camera bag?

Do you want to see that stolen photo? Here's Dustin's photo that was stolen by a roofing company and used in an ad in a magazine.
