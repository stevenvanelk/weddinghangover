This week we're talking detail photos and Steve shares a huge mistake he made while shooting details at a recent wedding. We're also talking about SEO and teaching other people how to fly drones, because there's only one expert drone pilot that young drone enthusiasts trust when it's time to learn to fly. We also talk about changing your style to match vendors you want to work with and using wedding hashtags.
