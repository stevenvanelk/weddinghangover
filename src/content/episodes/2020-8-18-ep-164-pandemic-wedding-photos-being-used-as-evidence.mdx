description: "This week we're talking about the possibility of your photos being used as evidence in a court of law. That's right, if you take photos of people not social distancing or not wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic, there's a possibility you could be served a warrant and forced to turn over your photos. Which we're all for. We're also talking about how Nikon should leave the camera industry, Kodak's insider trading scandal, Instagram spam, and photographers losing clients because they support Black Lives Matter. We also take a trip to the drone zone and Dustin shares a story of a recent crash and we talk about the impact of drones on wildlife."

This week we're talking about the possibility of your photos being used as evidence in a court of law. That's right, if you take photos of people not social distancing or not wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic, there's a possibility you could be served a warrant and forced to turn over your photos. Which we're all for. We're also talking about how Nikon should leave the camera industry, Kodak's insider trading scandal, Instagram spam, and photographers losing clients because they support Black Lives Matter. We also take a trip to the drone zone and Dustin shares a story of a recent crash and we talk about the impact of drones on wildlife.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Blood Orange Gold Standard from Taxman Brewing Company  
Steven - Alpha King from Three Floyds Brewing Co.

Do you change prices in the name of coronavirus?  
How much do you hate how casual rescheduling weddings has become due to the pandemic?  
What do you do if you delete a client's gallery as your contract stated you would, and then can't find their photos on your hard drive when they tell you they forgot to download their photos before the gallery expired?  
What do you say if your friend takes the smooth filter a bit too far when editing photos of you?  
What do you do if another photographer offers to edit your client's photos because they think you did a poor job on the edit?
