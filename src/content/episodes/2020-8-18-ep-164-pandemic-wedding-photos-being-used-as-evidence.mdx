description: "This week we're talking about the possibility of your photos being used as evidence in a court of law. That's right, if you take photos of people not social distancing or not wearing masks during the coronavirus pandemic, there's a possibility you could be served a warrant and forced to turn over your photos. Which we're all for. We're also talking about how Nikon should leave the camera industry, Kodak's insider trading scandal, Instagram spam, and photographers losing clients because they support Black Lives Matter. We also take a trip to the drone zone and Dustin shares a story of a recent crash and we talk about the impact of drones on wildlife."
