Then we talk about our thoughts about photoshopping acne and the couple that sent a 30 page critique to their photographer. Story on Petapixel:

After that we talk about vendors illegally using photos in advertisements. Then we have a brief discussion about the Shoot and Share contest.

## Q&A:
- Should you stay in a meeting with someone that yelled at you?

## After Show:
Steve raves about The Adventure Zone in the after show. It's good.
