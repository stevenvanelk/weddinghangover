Has your camera been yeeted by a groomsman recently? Has a subpar Tik Tok photographer taken crappy photos of your couple during your allotted photography time? Has someone tried to scam you on Instagram by making you feel like an influencer? We're here to help you out this week. Plus, Canon closes its headquarters and Sony adds the ability to shut the shutter on the A9 while changing lenses via a firmware update.

## Beer Talk:  
Steve - Dragonfly IPA from Upland Brewing Co.  
Dustin - Fat Tire from New Belgium Brewing

## Q&A:
- How do you write captions for social media during a global pandemic?
- What's going on with these FaceTime sessions where photographers are just taking screen shots of the session and editing them?
- Should I credit the photog who took the photos if I edited them? Should I credit myself as the editor? What should I do?
- Should I shoot an influencers engagement session for free and if so what should I expect?
- What gifts do people give to booking clients?
- Should a planner be allowed to invite a second photographer to a styled shoot I planned with them?
- Should I go outside during this pandemic?
