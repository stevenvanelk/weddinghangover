This is a question heavy episode. Jenn, Steve’s wife, fills in for Dustin this week because he’s incapacitated. Steve and Jenn answer questions from the internet in this action filled episode.

## Beer Talk:  
Jenn’s drinking an Apple Pie Wine from Oliver Winery.  
Steve’s drinking a Two Hearted from Bells Brewery.

## It's almost all Q&A:
- Have you guys shot a disabled wedding before and do you have any thoughts on posing, apart from close ups looking down, so the bride (who isn't disabled) doesn't look like the caretaker?
- Why do brides send timelines to vendors that include lots of extraneous information?
- Have you ever been in a creative rut and feel that the work you’re producing is crap? If so, what do you do?
- The bride's dad passed away three weeks ago. How should you attack that situation?

## Gear Talk:
Call in about the [Fuji XT-3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H3Y9CJY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H3Y9CJY&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenvanelk-20&linkId=8ba8765ded51c18e0bf70648637e123f) from Carl Osmond of Driftwood Media Productions.

## More Q&A:
- The family gave me a boutonniere on the wedding day. What am I supposed to do with this? I'm the photographer. Has anyone else been given a boutonniere or corsage while shooting?
- SOS... How can I avoid black holes for eyes? I understand basic editing. I've tried radial filters, brushes and levels and nothing seems to help. Can anyone help?
