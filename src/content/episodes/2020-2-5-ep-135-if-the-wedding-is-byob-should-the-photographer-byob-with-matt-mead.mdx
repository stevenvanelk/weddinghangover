We're talking with Matt Mead about drinking with clients and music selection for client meetings. Matt's a wedding photographer in Erie, Pennsylvania. He has a background in commercial photography, shooting a lot of real estate and also hockey photos, but his real passion is for weddings. We talk with Matt about awkward situations he's gotten into while shooting as well as how he puts his personality on display at client meetings.

## Q&A:
- What do I do if there's women's underwear in my camera bag on the wedding day?
- How do I recover from opening my computer in a client meeting and having the pie scene from American Pie open?
- What do you do if the client says the wedding is BYOB and encourages you to BYOB?
- How do you deal with negative comments on your Facebook page?
