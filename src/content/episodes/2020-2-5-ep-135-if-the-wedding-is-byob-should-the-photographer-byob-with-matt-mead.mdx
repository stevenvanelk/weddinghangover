## Q&A:  
What do I do if there's women's underwear in my camera bag on the wedding day?  
How do I recover from opening my computer in a client meeting and having the pie scene from American Pie open?  
What do you do if the client says the wedding is BYOB and encourages you to BYOB?  
How do you deal with negative comments on your Facebook page?
