Second off, we didn't have time to record this week, so instead of leaving everyone hanging we're putting up some segments from some of our Patreon episodes to give people an idea of what the Patreon content is like. So, if you're already on the Patreon, sorry."

This week's episode is a little weird. First off, it's explicit. Don't listen to it at work or in front of your kids. Second off, we didn't have time to record this week, so instead of leaving everyone hanging we're putting up some segments from some of our Patreon episodes to give people an idea of what the Patreon content is like. So, if you're already on the Patreon, sorry.

Buckle up this week and get ready to hear some weird stories we didn't think we'd ever share on the main feed, and also buckle up for some humor that's a bit more blue than usual. The Patreon is where we let loose. And to both our moms, if you're listening... we're sorry.
