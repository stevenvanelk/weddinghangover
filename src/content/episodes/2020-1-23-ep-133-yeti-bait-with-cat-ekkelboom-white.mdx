This week we're joined by Cat Ekkelboom-White all the way from Austria! Cat is an adventure and elopement photographer who shoots all over the world, but primarily in the Alps. On top of her phenomenal wedding and commercial photographer, Cat is also a Fujifilm X-Photographer. In this episode we're talking to Cat about her transition from being a composer/flautist to a photographer. We also talk about how she markets herself to shoot destination weddings in new locations and her transition from Canon to Fujifilm.

## Q&A:
- What would you do if your client demanded a yeti killing clause be added to the contract for the yeti hunt portion of their adventure wedding?
- How do you keep batteries warm while shooting in cold weather?
- What is the etiquette when shooting alongside a videographer? Who's in charge of posing?
- Should you include words like sh*t and f*ck in your Instagram profile and marketing if you use that sort of language?
