description: "What are your feelings about breakfast in bed? Do you brush your teeth first? Also, follow up about the 180 degree rule for video/film, new ARM MacBooks Pro, a wedding photographer that may have discovered a stone henge-like structure, and a weird rant about copped cameras and photoshop. We also talk about keeping that seed life spicy in the off season... when there's plenty of time for seed but when your spouse ain't making that money you just don't feel those feels like you used to. We also talk about the PPP loans and unemployment assistance in America."
