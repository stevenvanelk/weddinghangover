description: "In the first episode of Wedding Photo Hangover, Dustin and Steve talk about who they are, what their background is, why you should listen to their excellent podcast, and how you can convince your clients to book destination engagement sessions with you. There's also minimal talk about highlander wedding photographers, cool nick names, trips that made Dustin and Steve sick, and locations in the US that Steve likes (hint, Fort Wayne isn't one of them)."
