description: "This week we're talking with Boris Verks, the head of product at Dotphoton (now called Rawsie). We talk with Boris about raw files and about compressing them. We also talk to Boris about the White Stripes, the National, Iggy Pop, and David Bowie. And we talk a little bit about Mexican food and Italian food. But mostly we focus on what it is that Dotphoton is doing to help photographers save space. As these new cameras take photos that can take up 80 mb per picture, it's time to start thinking about how we all can save a little space."

## Q&A:  
Where can I get a printer for pictures that doesn't need electricity?  
If you had to survive with just two lenses what would they be?  
If a client comes to you for photos after they had photos done by someone else, do you keep your photos off social so as not to piss the other photographer off or do you go all alpha and post them?  
What do you do if a potential client tries to hire you to shoot the groom getting ready on the wedding day, but they already have a photographer hired for everything else and that photographer isn't the person contacting you?  
Is there a finer moment than starting the car to head home after finishing a triple?
