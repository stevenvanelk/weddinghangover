We're back with a somewhat normal episode... Well, as normal as we ever get over here. Dustin is concerned that Steve is cheating on him with Ulices Del Toro of the [**Wedding Photo Podcast**](http://www.deltorophoto.com/podcast). Dustin's doing bridal shows while Steve's been shooting in California and visiting Disneyland and Joshua Tree. Then we're talking about that Nikon D6 and the Canon EOS R5. Then, we're doing a lot of Q&A.

## Beer Talk:
Dustin - Copious amounts of cold and flu medicine

Steve - Head Start by Sufferfest

## Q&A:
- If you were cheated on do you stay or no way? (legitimately asked in Facebook photography group... because why not?)
- Is there anyone that'll shoot a wedding and hand over the RAWs for a photographer in need?
- Why do people think wedding photographers need to have a flash?
- Has anyone else ever had a DJ that refused to announce the wedding party at the reception and then somehow found themself roped into the role of announcing the wedding party?
- If you didn't give the bride that awful Pinterest inspired photo she forced you to take... then what do you do when she asks for it?

Also, we do a little post Imaging USA wrap up at the end. Specifically we talk about the karaoke bar we went to and what songs we should have put in to sing.
