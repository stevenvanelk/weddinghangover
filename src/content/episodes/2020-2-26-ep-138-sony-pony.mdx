  get over here. Dustin is concerned that Steve is cheating on him with Ulices Del

We're back with a somewhat normal episode... Well, as normal as we ever get over here. Dustin is concerned that Steve is cheating on him with Ulices Del Toro of the [**Wedding Photo Podcast**](http://www.deltorophoto.com/podcast). Dustin's doing bridal shows while Steve's been shooting in California and visiting Disneyland and Joshua Tree. Then we're talking about that Nikon D6 and the Canon EOS R5. Then, we're doing a lot of ## Q&A:.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Copious amounts of cold and flu medicine  
Steve - Head Start by Sufferfest

## Q&A:  
If you were cheated on do you stay or no way? (legitimately asked in Facebook photography group... because why not?)  
Is there anyone that'll shoot a wedding and hand over the RAWs for a photographer in need?  
Why do people think wedding photographers need to have a flash?  
Has anyone else ever had a DJ that refused to announce the wedding party at the reception and then somehow found themself roped into the role of announcing the wedding party?  
If you didn't give the bride that awful Pinterest inspired photo she forced you to take... then what do you do when she asks for it?

Also, we do a little post Imaging USA wrap up at the end. Specifically we talk about the karaoke bar we went to and what songs we should have put in to sing.
