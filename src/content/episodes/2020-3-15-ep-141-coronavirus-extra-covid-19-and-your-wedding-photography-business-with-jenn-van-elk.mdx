description: "We're releasing this special episode to talk about COVID-19 (perhaps better known as Coronavirus), and how it's affecting wedding photography businesses and the wedding industry. We know you're hearing a lot about this right now. We know a lot of you are experiencing cancellations (we are too). It's rough out there. So we wanted to talk a little bit about being proactive during this time, communicating with your clients and other professionals, and how you could use this time in relative isolation wisely. We also talk about some ideas for making extra money if you're experiencing cancellations and loss of income. We end the episode by talking about television shows we love watching and other things that make us happy and we hope some of those things bring you joy and comfort too as you're social distancing. We're all in this together, and we can all get through this. Just don't panic and remember to ask for help if you need it. We love you all."
