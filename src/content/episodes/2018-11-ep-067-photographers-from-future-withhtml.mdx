description: This week we're using some quantum entanglement to record an episode
  with Thom Stewart and Greg Campbell, who just so happen to live in the future. Well,
  I mean, like 15 - 17 hours ahead of us. We're talking about Photoshop for the iPad,
  Yongnuo's Mirrorless Camera, Yongnuo Flashes, Godox Flashes, Shooting with Sony,
  and also expressing milk while shooting a wedding (something none of us are really
  qualified to talk about, but whatever).

This week we're using some quantum entanglement to record an episode with Thom Stewart and Greg Campbell, who just so happen to live in the future. Well, I mean, like 15 - 17 hours ahead of us. We're talking about Photoshop for the iPad, Yongnuo's Mirrorless Camera, Yongnuo Flashes, Godox Flashes, Shooting with Sony, and also expressing milk while shooting a wedding (something none of us are really qualified to talk about, but whatever).

## Q&A:  
Does anyone have tips for setting up a vendor shoot?  
How can I book winter weddings at my current price point?
