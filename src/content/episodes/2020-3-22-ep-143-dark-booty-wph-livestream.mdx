description: "Howdy partners! WPH went live this week in the facebook group. We talk a lot about COVID-19 and the continued effect it is having on wedding photographers. We can promise that future episodes won't be so pandemic focused, but we can't promise they'll be as much fun as this one. This might be the best episode we've ever done. So come listen to Dustin do his Dustin thing, and listen to Steve criticize Dustin for doing Dustin (that's kind of Steve's thing after all)."

Howdy partners! WPH went live this week in the facebook group. We talk a lot about COVID-19 and the continued effect it is having on wedding photographers. We can promise that future episodes won't be so pandemic focused, but we can't promise they'll be as much fun as this one. This might be the best episode we've ever done. So come listen to Dustin do his Dustin thing, and listen to Steve criticize Dustin for doing Dustin (that's kind of Steve's thing after all).

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Blackberry Farm  
Steve - Glutenberg Stout

## Q&A:
- Can we go live more often?
- Will the Canon EOS R5 really be $3499?
- Why are you guys wearing your Sony Pony shirts?
- How do you film weddings without the camera stops every 30 minutes?
- What do you think of "fake watercolor" images?
- Would you consider changing your editing style for a client?
- How do you estimate losses for the wedding part of your businesses due to the coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic?
- How can you speed up your editing process?
- Is it a "jerk" move to buy the domains for my competitors websites and redirect those domains to my site?

Here’s the Animorph image [Devon Rowland](https://www.devonrowland.com) made.
