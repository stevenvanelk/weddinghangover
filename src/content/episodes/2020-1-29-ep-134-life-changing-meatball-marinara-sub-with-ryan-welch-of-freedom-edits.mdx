description: "Ryan Welch of Freedom Edits joins us to talk about life-changing meatball marinara sub. Then we talk about how to fix Subway. We also talk about getting started as a wedding photographer at the age of 16, scaling a business from 30 weddings a year to 100 and then to 200, and the difficulties that come with running an editing company that does millions of photo edits every month. It's a great episode, so cancel your plans, put your headphones in and watch the Britney Spears Toxic music video to get ready."

Ryan Welch of Freedom Edits joins us to talk about life-changing meatball marinara sub. Then we talk about how to fix Subway. We also talk about getting started as a wedding photographer at the age of 16, scaling a business from 30 weddings a year to 100 and then to 200, and the difficulties that come with running an editing company that does millions of photo edits every month. It's a great episode, so cancel your plans, put your headphones in and watch the Britney Spears Toxic music video to get ready.

## Q&A:  
How do I keep from disturbing the fairies while shooting a wedding in a fairy fort?  
Why am I seeing my reflection in the mirrors of my photos after they come back from my editor?  
Is it over dramatic to get upset if someone edits your photo and reposts without permission?  
What do dark and moody editors do when they get a subject with bad skin texture/color?
