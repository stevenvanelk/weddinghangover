description: It's our 50th Episode! This week Steve's drinking a Bourbon Barrel Aged
  Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane and we're talking photo stuff. We answer the question
  what is a dollar dance? We talk about letting an intern edit your photos. We talk
  about the Kickstarter for Magbox (one of us bought/invested/threw money away at
  this). We talk about the court case that ruled that a photo wasn't protected by
  copyright because it was a factual depiction.

It's our 50th Episode! This week Steve's drinking a Bourbon Barrel Aged Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane and we're talking photo stuff. We answer the question what is a dollar dance? We talk about letting an intern edit your photos. We talk about the Kickstarter for Magbox (one of us bought/invested/threw money away at this). We talk about the court case that ruled that a photo wasn't protected by copyright because it was a factual depiction.

Then it's on to ## Q&A:! What do you do if you need to use the restroom during a wedding? Talking #2.

How do you capture someone's personality if they don't have any interests? What would be a good price for a wedding with unlimited edited photos at the end... because someone did it and then was flustered when the bride asked for more photos.
