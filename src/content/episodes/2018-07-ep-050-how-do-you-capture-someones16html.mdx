description: "It's our 50th Episode! This week Steve's drinking a Bourbon Barrel Aged Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane and we're talking photo stuff. We answer the question what is a dollar dance? We talk about letting an intern edit your photos. We talk about the Kickstarter for Magbox (one of us bought/invested/threw money away at this). We talk about the court case that ruled that a photo wasn't protected by copyright because it was a factual depiction."
