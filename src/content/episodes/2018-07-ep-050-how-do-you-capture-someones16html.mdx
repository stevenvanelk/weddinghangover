description: "It's our 50th Episode! This week Steve's drinking a Bourbon Barrel Aged Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane and we're talking photo stuff. We answer the question what is a dollar dance? We talk about letting an intern edit your photos. We talk about the Kickstarter for Magbox (one of us bought/invested/threw money away at this). We talk about the court case that ruled that a photo wasn't protected by copyright because it was a factual depiction."

It's our 50th Episode! 

## Beer Talk:
Steve's drinking a Bourbon Barrel Aged Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet Lane

## Topics:
We answer the question what is a dollar dance? We talk about letting an intern edit your photos. We talk about the Kickstarter for Magbox (one of us bought/invested/threw money away at this). We talk about the court case that ruled that a photo wasn't protected by copyright because it was a factual depiction.

## Q&A:  
- What do you do if you need to use the restroom during a wedding? Talking #2. 
- How do you capture someone's personality if they don't have any interests?
- What would be a good price for a wedding with unlimited edited photos at the end... because someone did it and then was flustered when the bride asked for more photos.
