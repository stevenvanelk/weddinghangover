description: "This week we're diving deep into all of the good news. We've spent so many weeks discussing terrible things. We're getting dragged down by it. So, we're talking about an SD card error, weird must list requests, the photographer and his wife that replanted an entire forest, paying for photos without a watermark, anti-selfies, and a Wakanda inspired newborn shoot."
