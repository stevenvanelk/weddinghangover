description: Dustin and his cool dad friend, Steve, talk about DC accents, their first
  shoots with people since the pandemic ended, a wedding photographer arrested for
  shooting during the pandemic, falling mirrorless camera sales, grandmothers ordered
  to remove photos of their children from Facebook, a man arrested for posting to
  Instagram (because he violated quarantine), and the crazy Copper Stallion Media
  saga and their drama with a former client, Justin Montney. Also lots of Drone Zone
  talk this week. Steve pitches a Duck Hunt parody called Drone Hunt, DJI might have
  to stop selling drones in the USA, Dustin pitches starting a blackmarket DJI drone
  reselling company, Art Streiber shoots Catherine O'Hara with a drone, a man shoots
  down a drone and is arrested, and a village head uses a drone to distribute masks
  to people.
