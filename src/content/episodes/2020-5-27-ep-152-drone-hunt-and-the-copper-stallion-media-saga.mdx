description: "Dustin and his cool dad friend, Steve, talk about DC accents, their first shoots with people since the pandemic ended, a wedding photographer arrested for shooting during the pandemic, falling mirrorless camera sales, grandmothers ordered to remove photos of their children from Facebook, a man arrested for posting to Instagram (because he violated quarantine), and the crazy Copper Stallion Media saga and their drama with a former client, Justin Montney. Also lots of Drone Zone talk this week. Steve pitches a Duck Hunt parody called Drone Hunt, DJI might have to stop selling drones in the USA, Dustin pitches starting a blackmarket DJI drone reselling company, Art Streiber shoots Catherine O'Hara with a drone, a man shoots down a drone and is arrested, and a village head uses a drone to distribute masks to people."

Dustin and his cool dad friend, Steve, talk about DC accents, their first shoots with people since the pandemic ended, a wedding photographer arrested for shooting during the pandemic, falling mirrorless camera sales, grandmothers ordered to remove photos of their children from Facebook, a man arrested for posting to Instagram (because he violated quarantine), and the crazy Copper Stallion Media saga and their drama with a former client, Justin Montney. Also lots of Drone Zone talk this week. Steve pitches a Duck Hunt parody called Drone Hunt, DJI might have to stop selling drones in the USA, Dustin pitches starting a blackmarket DJI drone reselling company, Art Streiber shoots Catherine O'Hara with a drone, a man shoots down a drone and is arrested, and a village head uses a drone to distribute masks to people.

Oh and in case it's not apparent from our conversation in the episode, we find the actions of Copper Stallion Media to be absolutely deplorable.

## Q&A
- Is it best to have your instagram set to private?
- Do you like your business posts from your personal page?
- Anyone still fielding cancellations? Is it normal if 70% of your couples divorce?
- How should you respond to an email from a concerned bride about whether or not you'll have a second shooter?
