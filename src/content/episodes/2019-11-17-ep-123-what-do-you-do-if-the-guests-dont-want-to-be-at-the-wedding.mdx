How can we pay attention to photos and videos and audio when Lady and the Tramp is available to stream in both animation and live action? We talk a lot about Dustin's impending Santa Sessions in this episode. We also talk about lasers blasting camera sensors, Kurt Russel being sexy af, weird spammy emails and how we can replicate them for our businesses, and flying a drone at a condo after the property manager said it was a no drone zone."

Disney+ is out and it's tampering with our editing schedules. How can we pay attention to photos and videos and audio when Lady and the Tramp is available to stream in both animation and live action? We talk a lot about Dustin's impending Santa Sessions in this episode. We also talk about lasers blasting camera sensors, Kurt Russel being sexy af, weird spammy emails and how we can replicate them for our businesses, and flying a drone at a condo after the property manager said it was a no drone zone.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Puppy Slumber Party from Metazoa Brewing Co.  
Steve - Tiberius Double IPA from Scarlet Lane Brewing Company

## Q&A:
- What should I do if my couple canceled the wedding and then rebooked on a different day and I said dit was okay, but two weeks out I discovered they were marrying different people at different locations?
- How do I respond to a client that already booked me for a Photo Booth when they say they want an unnecessary face to face meeting?
- What do you do when you can tell the guests at a wedding don't want to be there?
