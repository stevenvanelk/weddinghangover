description: "First up, and most importantly, we're donating all the money the podcast makes this month to Black Lives Matter. We both support BLM and we think you should too. Now, on to our normal show notes... We have a lot of follow up about the Copper Stallion Media story. We didn't do a great job in our discussion of that last episode. Then we're talking about a lady who lost business due to supporting BLM and how she handled it (which was commendable). Central Camera in Chicago burns down and the owner says he's not made about it. He's just mad about what happened to George Floyd. Then we talk about Shiftcam, BS with Dan Mace, drone deliveries, a 96 mph Mavic 2 Pro, and the Wedding Photographers who claim they need 1k subs to livestream a wedding."

First up, and most importantly, we're donating all the money the podcast makes this month to [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/). We both support BLM and we think you should too. Now, on to our normal show notes... We have a lot of follow up about the Copper Stallion Media story. We didn't do a great job in our discussion of that last episode. Then we're talking about a lady who lost business due to supporting BLM and how she handled it (which was commendable). Central Camera in Chicago burns down and the owner says he's not made about it. He's just mad about what happened to George Floyd. Then we talk about Shiftcam, BS with Dan Mace, drone deliveries, a 96 mph Mavic 2 Pro, and the Wedding Photographers who claim they need 1k subs to livestream a wedding.
