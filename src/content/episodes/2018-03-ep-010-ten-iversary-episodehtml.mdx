description: In this episode we finally get around to doing the drawing for that giveaway,
  but you're going to have to wait till the end of the episode to find that out. In
  the meantime, Steve, a great Indiana man that drinks great Indiana beer, slums it
  with a great Ohio beer from MadTree Brewing called PsycHOPathy. Dustin's drinking
  a Leinenkugel Oktoberfest. Next up, Steve and Dustin discuss what they shot this
  weekend. Steve brags about his wife and her excellent work, while Dustin talks about
  shooting without his wife. The talk turns toward religion but quickly veers away
  as Steve and Dustin aren't equipped to discuss this topic at all. Dustin tries to
  talk about his experience in New York seeing a celebrities show, while Steve constantly
  interrupts him. Then finally, we move on to the good stuff. We talk about that new
  DJI Zenmuse x7 and Inspire 2 and how excited we are by this product. Dustin's a
  little jazzed about the new Sony a7S III, but since we don't know anything about
  it we quickly move onto Dustin playing around with the Sony a9.

In this episode we finally get around to doing the drawing for that giveaway, but you're going to have to wait till the end of the episode to find that out. In the meantime, Steve, a great Indiana man that drinks great Indiana beer, slums it with a great Ohio beer from MadTree Brewing called PsycHOPathy. Dustin's drinking a Leinenkugel Oktoberfest. Next up, Steve and Dustin discuss what they shot this weekend. Steve brags about his wife and her excellent work, while Dustin talks about shooting without his wife. The talk turns toward religion but quickly veers away as Steve and Dustin aren't equipped to discuss this topic at all. Dustin tries to talk about his experience in New York seeing a celebrities show, while Steve constantly interrupts him. Then finally, we move on to the good stuff. We talk about that new DJI Zenmuse x7 and Inspire 2 and how excited we are by this product. Dustin's a little jazzed about the new Sony a7S III, but since we don't know anything about it we quickly move onto Dustin playing around with the Sony a9.

Next up we talk about whether or not it's a good idea to bring cameras with you on vacation. Steve talks about his many failures as a wedding photographer, social media personality, and just human being in general. Dustin declines to engage with Steve on this topic. Then we talk about that new Google Pixel phone and talk about whether or not we're interested in it. Finally, we answer some more questions from listeners... and random questions Steve found on the internet. We talk about baby photography, wedding restroom etiquette, and getting grooms who don't want their photo taken to work it for the camera. Then Dustin and Steve talk about the sound quality of Steve's voice.
