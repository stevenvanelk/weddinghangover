description: "In this episode we finally get around to doing the drawing for that giveaway, but you're going to have to wait till the end of the episode to find that out. In the meantime, Steve, a great Indiana man that drinks great Indiana beer, slums it with a great Ohio beer from MadTree Brewing called PsycHOPathy. Dustin's drinking a Leinenkugel Oktoberfest. Next up, Steve and Dustin discuss what they shot this weekend. Steve brags about his wife and her excellent work, while Dustin talks about shooting without his wife. The talk turns toward religion but quickly veers away as Steve and Dustin aren't equipped to discuss this topic at all. Dustin tries to talk about his experience in New York seeing a celebrities show, while Steve constantly interrupts him. Then finally, we move on to the good stuff. We talk about that new DJI Zenmuse x7 and Inspire 2 and how excited we are by this product. Dustin's a little jazzed about the new Sony a7S III, but since we don't know anything about it we quickly move onto Dustin playing around with the Sony a9."
