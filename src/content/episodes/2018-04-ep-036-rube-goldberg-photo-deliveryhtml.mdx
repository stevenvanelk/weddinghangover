## Show Notes:
Steve and Dustin are talking about social media, a lot, and specifically about something super douchey that Steve did... Also, Steve does some social media sleuthing as he tries to get to the bottom of the biggest mystery he's ever uncovered on Twitter. We talk a little about new Twitter policy changes and Dustin's sudden growth on Instagram too. Then we talk about how you can set yourself apart from every other person at the wedding with a DSLR, especially the videographers.

## Q&A:
- How do I build a wedding portfolio and get started in the wedding photography industry?
- How do I save photos and send them to people if I have a computer without a CD drive?
- Why do photographers say they're giving a discount because they only have a few slots left when everyone knows if that were true they'd raise prices, not lower them?
