We were joined this week by Lisa Mark and Rebecca Lozer of the Secret Life of Weddings Podcast. Settle in to hear about how Lisa and Rebecca got started doing photography and how they discovered their styles. Also, Lisa and Rebecca share the impetus behind why they started the Secret Life of Weddings. There’s a lot more in the episode so hit download and get ready to have a good time.

## Q&A:  
- Is it ok to message a past client who got divorced and then engaged again to see if they want to use your as their photographer a second time?  
- Who’s fiscally responsible for an album ruined at a client meeting, the photographer or the client that ruined it?  
- Is it possible for your tongue to get stuck to a lens if it’s really cold outside?
