## Beer Talk:
First up we're drinking beer... Or at least Steve is.  
Steve - Necron 99 from Three Floyds. 

## Follow Up:
We start with an apology for not giving Dustin's weird bluetooth headphones a Kickstarter Failure spot. Then we talk about the bill the president signed into law making it so drones have to be registered even for recreational use. After that we talk about drone laws in the Dominican Republic.

## Topics:
Finally out of follow up, we talk about what you should do if your cloud gallery account is hacked and we briefly discuss safety measures to help protect your accounts. Then we talk about a pinhole camera lens that's being kickstarted on which, unfortunately, Dustin isn't wasting his money. Check it out here:

Then we talk about the pros and cons of moving to a studio before we head to a round of Q&A.

## Q&A:
- Should you calibrate your lenses and how do you do it?
- How to deal with brides that seem to be stringing you along?
- Do you like wide angle lenses and wide angle distortion?

## After Show:
 Then finally it's all over except for a little talk about Star Wars and Star Wars toys (but this was pre-The Last Jedi release date, so no spoilers here).
