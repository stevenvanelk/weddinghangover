The mayoral campaign is over. The DJI Mavic Mini is out. Dustin's learning how to circumvent no fly zones with his drone, legally. Steve's doing corporate shoots and having Buscemi problems. We also talk Google Photos limits and the retouching features that Google consulted with wedding photographers on to get just right. Steve talks about his experience playing around with Fujifilm cameras at a Drink and Click meetup.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Pumking by Southern Tier Brewing Company  
Steve - Black by Centerpoint Brewing Company and Novemberfest and Troll Storm by Sun King Brewery

## Q&A:
- If the answer to a proposal session was no, do you still deliver the photos?
- What do you do if you go to the wrong church? How do you keep that from happening in the future?
- How do you organize your collections in Lightroom?
