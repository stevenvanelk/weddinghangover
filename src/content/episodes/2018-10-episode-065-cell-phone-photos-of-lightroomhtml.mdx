Special Guest Interview:  
Joe Fischer of Greetabl

## Q&A:  
A venue stole my photos and posted on their instagram without crediting me, even after I messaged them about it. What should I do?  
Has anyone heard of venues banning vendors, specifically videographers and/or photographers, from the ceremony so that they can capture it themselves and offer that as an upscale to their prospective clients?
