This week the podcast was edited by Dustin. Please, direct all your comments about the editing directly to him.

Come experience the fresh hell that Dustin put me through this week. It's an entire episode with a focal point on gear talk. It's terrible. Or at least I think it is. In Dustin's words:

"This week we cover all things lenses. From start to finish, how wide is too wide, how shallow is (steve) too shallow. You get it."

## Q&A:  
How many images is too many to deliver?   
Comfy Shoes to wear on a wedding day?   
What to do when you're picked 2nd?   
We also geek out about the new Netflix show Sabrina & Riverdale's cinematography
