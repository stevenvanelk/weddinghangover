Come experience the fresh hell that Dustin put me through this week. It's an entire episode with a focal point on gear talk. It's terrible. Or at least I think it is. In Dustin's words:

This week we cover all things lenses. From start to finish, how wide is too wide, how shallow is (steve) too shallow. You get it.

Q/A:  
How many images is too many to deliver?   
Comfy Shoes to wear on a wedding day?   
What to do when you're picked 2nd?   
We also geek out about the new Netflix show Sabrina & Riverdale's cinematography
