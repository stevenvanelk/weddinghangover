description: "This week we welcome Ulices Del Toro back to the podcast to talk about life after having a baby. We also talk about the Sony A1 and the Fujifilm GFX 100s a little (but not too much because neither of us have those cameras). The photographer of the viral Bernie Sanders photo was interviewed by Rolling Stone and had some thoughts to share about his photo and we also talk about Airmap suggesting that drone flights be monetized by the government."

This week we welcome Ulices Del Toro back to the podcast to talk about life after having a baby. We also talk about the Sony A1 and the Fujifilm GFX 100s a little (but not too much because neither of us have those cameras).

## Q&A:  
If you team up with another photographer to offer video, should you brand your video on your own or let your video just fall under their brand?  
If a wedding is rescheduled and then happens without the photographer, but the clients still want photos in their wedding attire, what do you charge them?  
If you don't want people giving speeches and doing vows to stare at their phones, then is gifting them notebooks or vow books a good idea?
