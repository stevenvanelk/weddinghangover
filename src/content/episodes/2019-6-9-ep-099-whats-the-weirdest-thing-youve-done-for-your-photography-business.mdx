description: "This week we're talking a lot about that new Mac Pro from Apple. It may look like a cheese grater, but we're pretty certain it doesn't grate cheese. Steve posits a theory about Patrick Rothfuss's book series The Kingkiller Chronicle which is oddly related to this new Mac Pro. We talk about what you should do if a bride asks you not to take many photos of a bridesmaid. We also talk about what it's like to do photography in your thirties."

This week we're talking a lot about that new Mac Pro from Apple. It may look like a cheese grater, but we're pretty certain it doesn't grate cheese. Steve posits a theory about Patrick Rothfuss's book series The Kingkiller Chronicle which is oddly related to this new Mac Pro. We talk about what you should do if a bride asks you not to take many photos of a bridesmaid. We also talk about what it's like to do photography in your thirties.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Margarita Style Spin-Off from Taxman Brewing Co.  
Steve and Dustin - NATURDAY from Natural Light!

## Q&A:
- What's the weirdest thing you've done for your photography business?
- How do you critique a second shooter that's disappointed you?
- Should you give money back to someone who cancelled their contract because they no longer want to do a complimentary shoot that was included in their contract?
