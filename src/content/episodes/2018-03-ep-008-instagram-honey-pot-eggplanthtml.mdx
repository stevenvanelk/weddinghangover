description: In this episode there's some more cheese talk. Dustin has a Colby-jack
  wedding couple. Then we're back to the beer. Dustin's drinking a Harvest Hefe from
  Samuel Adams, while Steve is drinking another great Indiana beer for a great Indiana
  man, like Steve. This week he finally cracked open an Eirik Bloodaxe from Scarlet
  Lane. Then Steve and Dustin talk about shooting while sick. Steve gives Dustin a
  primer on what his wife and him call 'traditional coverage' for the wedding day.
  Dustin briefly tells the heartbreaking story of what happened to one of his lenses
  this past weekend. Then we revisit a topic from previous weeks, off-camera flash
  and triggers. Dustin briefly talks about what brand he ditched Pocket Wizard to
  use and then Dustin and Steve share their thoughts about the new Profoto A1 Speed
  Lights. Hot light bling. Then it's on to Steve explaining the term honey dick to
  Dustin, and asking him why he would use that on the official Instagram account.
  After that Steve and Dustin briefly talk about firesafes. Steve gets asked to join
  the Illuminati on Instagram. Steve gives Dustin a brief explanation of what's changed
  in the Instagram Explore tab.
