First up, Steve is drinking a Cabin Fever from New Holland Brewing Company while Dustin is on that tequila.

Then it's on to extreme wedding photography. One couple got married on a net over a canyon, 400 feet over the canyon floor.

Another couple got married in front of an active volcano.

Then we talk about Vimeo's new data cap for their basic users. After that Dustin talks about buying some designer blue light glasses:

(nevermind, that link is now broken)

Steve informs Dustin of Night Shift (from Apple) and F.lux so he doesn't waste his money on another weird product he found on the internet.

Night Shift:

F.lux:

Then it's on to QA//www.secretlifeofweddings.com/)  
(it's a good show, Steve highly recommends it).
