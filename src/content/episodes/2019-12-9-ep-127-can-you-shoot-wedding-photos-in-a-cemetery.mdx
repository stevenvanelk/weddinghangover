description: "First up we’re talking about that new Black widow trailer before we get into Instagram Analytics and doctor visits. It’s been a crazy year but I think we can all agree that Black Widow is so much better than Hawkeye. Next up we talk about Dustin’s experiments with Facebook Live and his big switch to Sony. We also talk about Steve’s purchase of just one measly monopod over the Black Friday sales, and Steve’s new found love of Rogue Filters. Then we talk about the Canon Eos Rs that’s rumored to be announced in February as well as the Canon Eos hybrid mount camera rumor (that’s an EF/RF mount camera, so you can use your old lenses on a new body without an adaptor). Finally, we talk about how everyone needs to stop telling their friends to buy Sony gear. Talk up some crappy brands so that Sony has competition. We don’t want a monopoly. So tell your frenemies to go for a Fujifilm or Canon or Nikon or Panasonic this year and tell your enemies to go with Olympus."
