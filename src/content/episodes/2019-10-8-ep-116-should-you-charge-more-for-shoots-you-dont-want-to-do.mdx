description: It's fall. We're busy and the planet looks like it's slowly dying a beautiful
  death. This week we're talking about videographers getting all up in our business.
  People posting candid photos from weddings and then saying they need a photographer
  that can recreate that for them at their wedding. We also talk about disappointing
  food at weddings.

It's fall. We're busy and the planet looks like it's slowly dying a beautiful death. This week we're talking about videographers getting all up in our business. People posting candid photos from weddings and then saying they need a photographer that can recreate that for them at their wedding. We also talk about disappointing food at weddings.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Oktoberfest from Great Lakes Brewing Co.  
Steven - Screamsicle Horrorhound from Scarlet Lane Brewing Co.

## Q&A:  
What do you do when other vendors upload crappy iphone photos from the wedding and tag you to the photos?  
What cloud storage do you use?  
What hosting providers exist for your website that also do client galleries?  
Should you charge more for shoots you don't want to do?
