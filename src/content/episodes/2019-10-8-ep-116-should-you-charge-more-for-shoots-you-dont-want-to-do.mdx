It's fall. We're busy and the planet looks like it's slowly dying a beautiful death. This week we're talking about videographers getting all up in our business. People posting candid photos from weddings and then saying they need a photographer that can recreate that for them at their wedding. We also talk about disappointing food at weddings.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Oktoberfest from Great Lakes Brewing Co.  
Steven - Screamsicle Horrorhound from Scarlet Lane Brewing Co.

## Q&A:
- What do you do when other vendors upload crappy iphone photos from the wedding and tag you to the photos?
- What cloud storage do you use?
- What hosting providers exist for your website that also do client galleries?
- Should you charge more for shoots you don't want to do?
