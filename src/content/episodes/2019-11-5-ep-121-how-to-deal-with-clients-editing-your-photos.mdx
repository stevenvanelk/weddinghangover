description: "Dustin tells a story about a photographer that was telling lies about him. Steve basically asks Dustin, 'You mad bro?' Then we talk about the Canon 1Dx Mark III, the Canon Ra, and the possible Canon Rx. Also, Canon's going to make mirrorless cameras even smaller, according to a new patent. Then we're talking about Clickbait and making up our own clickbait headlines that are even better. Finally we talk about the new Mavic Mini that's coming out... but we were talking about it the day before the news was released when some company accidentally leaked the marketing materials."

Dustin tells a story about a photographer that was telling lies about him. Steve basically asks Dustin, "You mad bro?" Then we talk about the Canon 1Dx Mark III, the Canon Ra, and the possible Canon Rx. Also, Canon's going to make mirrorless cameras even smaller, according to a new patent. Then we're talking about Clickbait and making up our own clickbait headlines that are even better. Finally we talk about the new Mavic Mini that's coming out... but we were talking about it the day before the news was released when some company accidentally leaked the marketing materials.
