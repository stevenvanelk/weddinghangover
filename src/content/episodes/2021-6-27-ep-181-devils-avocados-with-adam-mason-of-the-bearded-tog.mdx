Adam Mason of The Bearded Tog and Mason Photography joins us this week to talk about life, photography, music, cryptocurrency, scientific films, dogecoin and the movie Whiplash. Steve and Adam also talk about conference photography, political photography, and commercial work. The also talk about whether or not your mortgage company cares about how you made your money.

## Q&A:
- Should I let my husband second shoot for other female photographers when he's never shown an interest in it before but one of my competitors keeps asking if she can hire him? 
- I grew my beard out and we stopped booking clients, should I shave my beard so we can make money again? 
- My sister thinks her photographer deleted her wedding photos because I brought my camera to the wedding. She's demanding I pay for a new wedding or else produce a complete gallery of her wedding when I didn't shoot anything but getting ready. What do I do? 
- I booked a client at a discount because I was supposed to get show photos from their BDSM conference on my site but when I showed up they took my phone and cards and forbid me from saving any photos anywhere. Can I ask for more money now since they didn't live up to their end of the agreement?
