description: "Steve and Dustin were together again, face to face and making the magic happen. First up, they're discussing an event they shot together just moments before they started recording. Then they're talking follow up, and they're talking about Oath, Yahoo, AOL, Flickr, and Style Me Pretty. Then they're talking fashion photography and whether or not fashion photographers make better wedding photographers than wedding photographers. Then they're moving on to talking about newborn baby photography sessions."

Steve and Dustin were together again, face to face and making the magic happen. First up, they're discussing an event they shot together just moments before they started recording. Then they're talking follow up, and they're talking about Oath, Yahoo, AOL, Flickr, and Style Me Pretty. Then they're talking fashion photography and whether or not fashion photographers make better wedding photographers than wedding photographers. Then they're moving on to talking about newborn baby photography sessions.

Then it's on to ## Q&A:! Questions include, what should I do if I'm second shooting a wedding and I contract an illness the week of the wedding, what do you do about shot lists, when you do a destination wedding does the client pay for travel and lodging expenses, and are stylized photoshoots hurting the wedding photography industry. It's a lot of questions.

Here's a link to that blog post Steve was talking about:
