description: "Steve and Dustin were together again, face to face and making the magic happen. First up, they're discussing an event they shot together just moments before they started recording. Then they're talking follow up, and they're talking about Oath, Yahoo, AOL, Flickr, and Style Me Pretty. Then they're talking fashion photography and whether or not fashion photographers make better wedding photographers than wedding photographers. Then they're moving on to talking about newborn baby photography sessions."
