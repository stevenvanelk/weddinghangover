description: In our third annual Thanksgiving special, we give thanks for all our
  blessings from this past year. It's been a great one so we have a lot to mention.
  We're both super thankful for our amazing families, for the great community that's
  formed around this podcast, and for listeners who leave positive reviews and then
  take a dump on Dustin's heart. What a blessing that last one was this past year.

In our third annual Thanksgiving special, we give thanks for all our blessings from this past year. It's been a great one so we have a lot to mention. We're both super thankful for our amazing families, for the great community that's formed around this podcast, and for listeners who leave positive reviews and then take a dump on Dustin's heart. What a blessing that last one was this past year.

But seriously, thank you all so much for continuing to listen and support the podcast. We look forward to doing a ton more episodes because of all the awesome listeners out there like all of you. Have a great Thanksgiving! For our non-American friends, have a great random Thursday in November where you have to hear Americans talk about things they're thankful for on the internet.
