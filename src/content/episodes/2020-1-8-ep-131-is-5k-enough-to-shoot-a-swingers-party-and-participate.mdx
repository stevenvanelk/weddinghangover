We're also talking about dealing with family photos, especially when there's an unwanted person in the photo. We also have some follow up about Hitachi and the other products they make besides hard drives. Also, Dustin almost got scammed on Facebook marketplace."

This week we're talking about Sony cars, Nikon's d780, Techart's EF to Z adapter, Canon's 1DX mark III and an Anker certified flash. We're also talking about dealing with family photos, especially when there's an unwanted person in the photo. We also have some follow up about Hitachi and the other products they make besides hard drives. Also, Dustin almost got scammed on Facebook marketplace.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Mucinex  
Steve - All Day IPA from Founders Brewing Company

## Q&A:
- Should you shoot a swingers party for $5k? What if they person hiring you says you can participate if you want, once you're done shooting?
- What should you do if the couple likes each other too much? Like kissing where there lips never touch, just their tongues?
- Should you include which vendors you blacklist on your website?
