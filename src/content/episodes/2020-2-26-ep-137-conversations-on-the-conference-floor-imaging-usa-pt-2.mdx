description: Here's part 2 of our two part episode from the Imaging USA conference.
  Steve's voice was wrecked in the first episode, and it's even more wrecked in this
  one. We went to a smoky bar and his voice finally gave up the ghost. Then we did
  all of these interviews. So once again, while everyone else was out there learning,
  we were talking to a bunch of companies at the trade show. Still weird. Still wild.
  In this episode we talk with Canon, Photobiz, B&H Photo Video Pro Audio, Gifyyy
  and Kiss (a great Indiana company).

Here's part 2 of our two part episode from the Imaging USA conference. Steve's voice was wrecked in the first episode, and it's even more wrecked in this one. We went to a smoky bar and his voice finally gave up the ghost. Then we did all of these interviews. So once again, while everyone else was out there learning, we were talking to a bunch of companies at the trade show. Still weird. Still wild. In this episode we talk with [Canon](https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog), [Photobiz](https://www.photobiz.com/), [B&H Photo Video Pro Audio](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/), [Gifyyy](https://gifyyy.com/) and [Kiss](https://www.kiss.us/) (a great Indiana company).
