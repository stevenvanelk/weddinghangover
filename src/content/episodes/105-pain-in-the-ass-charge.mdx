description: "Has your favorite government employee been fired for liking Tupac too much? Yeah, we're all feeling it this week. But it's okay, because we've got stories about a drunk that cleared a dance floor with her awful smell, a mistake on Amazon that allowed people to buy gear for under $100, a new Sony A7r IV, a new DJI Roni-SC, the world's first Solargraphy time-lapse, the smallest full frame camera (from Sigma), and the Moment Air Kickstarter! Plus we reveal more to the story of the 'influencer' with 55k followers who wanted free wedding videos made and got rejected by Betrothed and Co."

Has your favorite government employee been fired for liking Tupac too much? Yeah, we're all feeling it this week. But it's okay, because we've got stories about a drunk that cleared a dance floor with her awful smell, a mistake on Amazon that allowed people to buy gear for under $100, a new Sony A7r IV, a new DJI Roni-SC, the world's first Solargraphy time-lapse, the smallest full frame camera (from Sigma), and the Moment Air Kickstarter! Plus we reveal more to the story of the "influencer" with 55k followers who wanted free wedding videos made and got rejected by Betrothed and Co.
