description: "This week is big! We have special messages from a bunch of past guests. We're talking about Dobby being spotted on camera! We talk about the USMNT and the USWNT (Go USWNT! Win the World Cup!). We also talk about a blind photographer, women hiring photographers to capture their dating profile pics, a wedding crasher caught on camera by a wedding photographer, an octopus that stole a camera, a drunk gorilla that punched a photographer, and the perfect photo of a Great White shark that mimics Jaws."
