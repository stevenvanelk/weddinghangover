description: "This week Dustin and Steve have their friend Ulices Del Toro back on the podcast to form the Blue Shirt Boys group and also to talk about some gear that Sony put out. Like that amazing CF Express type A card and corresponding card reader. Or those new touch screen menus that Sony made. Or those hybrid card slots they created... and yes, I guess we get around to talking about the new Sony a7S III. We solve the overheating issues that both the Sony a7S III and the Canon EOS R5 are experiencing while shooting outside, with one cool product Sony put out that isn't even camera related. We also talk about the photographer that tracked down a couple getting married on the Brooklyn Bridge (to chorus) to give them a photo. We discuss whether or not you should be allowed to skip out on a wedding if people aren't wearing masks or social distancing. We also discuss Kodak's pivot to pharmaceuticals and GoPro's pivot to being a lifestyle brand. Then we talk about the improved eye autofocus on the Canon EOS R5 and Canon EOS R6 and there's a Nikon z5 coming out which will have dual card slots."

## Q&A:

* If a bride says their photographer doesn't allow videographers who they aren't friends with, but the bride already hired you for videography, what should you do?
* Should you buy URLs and redirect them to your site to try to boost your SEO?  
  If a client reschedules their wedding and has you shoot their intimate elopement and just subtracts the hours from their big wedding party package, but then after the elopement cancels the big wedding party and asks for a refund, what should you do?
* Should you do free work for a realtor to try to compete with his current photographer for future work?
* How do you respond to a client asking you to use their bodies to create shadow puppet photos?
