description: "Guess who's back?! Back Again! Stevie's Back! Tell your friends. We do have fun, don't we? This week on the podcast Steve's drinking a Flat 12 Bierworks Milk Stout and Dustin's back on that clear beverage he claims is water. Then there's a ton of follow up. Steve tells an embarrassing story about himself that he thought Dustin was referencing in the last episode. Steve gets to the bottom of whether or not Dustin really feels responsible when his couples divorce. Dustin gives some terrible excuse for why he keeps getting his soft box in photos that doesn't really make sense, but whatever... And finally we talk about some reasons why the photographer that shoots the proposal might not shoot the engagement session or the wedding. Finally, follow up is over."

Guess who's back?! Back Again! Stevie's Back! Tell your friends. We do have fun, don't we? This week on the podcast Steve's drinking a Flat 12 Bierworks Milk Stout and Dustin's back on that clear beverage he claims is water. Then there's a ton of follow up. Steve tells an embarrassing story about himself that he thought Dustin was referencing in the last episode. Steve gets to the bottom of whether or not Dustin really feels responsible when his couples divorce. Dustin gives some terrible excuse for why he keeps getting his soft box in photos that doesn't really make sense, but whatever... And finally we talk about some reasons why the photographer that shoots the proposal might not shoot the engagement session or the wedding. Finally, follow up is over.

Our first topic is whether or not we think it's a good idea to post prices to social media. Next we talk about whether you give discounts to couples that won't let you post their photos to your website or to social media. Then we talk about college graduation photos. Next up we talk about real estate photography and Dustin talks about being interviewed. Then we talk about a whether or not it's okay to be dismissive of educational classes about photography (kind of the inverse of being dismissive of photographers who didn't study photography in college). Then we talk about the controversy with the British Wildlife Photograph of the Year Award. Finally we intro a new segment which we'll probably end up calling Why Would You Post That? In this segment we talk about a photo we found on social media and discuss how ridiculous it is that someone posted it.

Here's a link to the article about the wildlife photo that was faked:

Here's a link to that photo on twitter (nevermind, itâ€™s been deleted):
