## Show Notes:
On this very special Halloween Spooktacular version of the show, Dustin and Steve talk about the scariest photography topics... but first they talk beer. 

## Beer Talk:
Dustin's drinking some basic shit again... Is his Leinenkugel Summer Shandy even worth mentioning in the show notes?
Meanwhile Steve's partaking of the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore, from Scarlet Lane of course.

## Topics:
Next up Steve and Dustin talk about what to do when a client ghosts you... and also when it's appropriate to ghost a potential client. Then they talk about superstitions that could ruin your life... and your wedding. So keep this podcast close to your heart and replay it before every wedding so you can keep your clients safe. After that Steve and Dustin talk about haunted venues. Notre Dame is briefly talked about, then Steve talks about the Inn at Irwin Gardens and shares his only spooky story. Next up Dustin talks about the Hannah House, one of the most haunted venues in the US, which is located right in Indianapolis. Then, if you're listening to the podcast, Steve massacres a story his wife told him about the Sealbach Hotel down in Louisville that involves the death of a bride.

## Q&A:
- What's a good spooky march for a wedding?
- How do you capture photos of a ghost?
- Is it possible to take pictures of a vampire?
