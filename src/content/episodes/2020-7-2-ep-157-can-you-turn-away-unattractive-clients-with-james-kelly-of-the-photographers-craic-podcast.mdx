## Beer Talk:  
James - some Spanish pish  
Steve - some American pish

## Q&A:  
Should you give a refund if the client pleads for a refund after calling off their wedding?  
What are your thoughts on someone referring an unattractive client to someone else because they don’t feel the client is pretty enough? (We hate it)  
What should you do if a 2021 couple wants to reschedule and give COVID-19 as their reason for rescheduling?
