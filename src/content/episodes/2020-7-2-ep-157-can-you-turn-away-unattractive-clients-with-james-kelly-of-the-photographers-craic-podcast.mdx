Steve talks with James Kelly of the Photographers Craic Podcast. Steve and James talk about the way COVID-19 has affected their very different countries and how they’re both coping. They also talk about James’s equine photography and a little bit about landscape. They also discuss price fixing, cartels and oligopolies.

## Beer Talk:  
James - some Spanish pish  
Steve - some American pish

## Q&A:
- Should you give a refund if the client pleads for a refund after calling off their wedding?
- What are your thoughts on someone referring an unattractive client to someone else because they don’t feel the client is pretty enough? (We hate it)
- What should you do if a 2021 couple wants to reschedule and give COVID-19 as their reason for rescheduling?
