description: "Dustin is back from Mexico and we're bringing that fire again. This week we're talking about a photographer that punched a groom in the nose (no jokes), the f/2.0 new holy trinity that Canon is rolling out, and guests applauding as the bride walks down the aisle... WTF is up with that? We're also taking a cold look at true crime again with the story of photographer who was caught scamming brides. Busted. But first we have some follow up about piñatas and the relative greenness of California compared to Indiana. Also, Steve's wife Jenn writes in to set the record straight on a lot of dumb stuff Steve has said."

Dustin is back from Mexico and we're bringing that fire again. This week we're talking about a photographer that punched a groom in the nose (no jokes), the f/2.0 new holy trinity that Canon is rolling out, and guests applauding as the bride walks down the aisle... WTF is up with that? We're also taking a cold look at true crime again with the story of photographer who was caught scamming brides. Busted. But first we have some follow up about piñatas and the relative greenness of California compared to Indiana. Also, Steve's wife Jenn writes in to set the record straight on a lot of dumb stuff Steve has said.
