It's our second annual Thanksgiving Special!

And once again, I couldn't find a picture either one of us has taken of a turkey for the episode image, so here's a cake!

Dustin and Steve talk about all the things they're thankful for this year. They talk about the origins of Thanksgiving as well. Then Dustin talks about Black Friday and deals, deals, deals. But we wouldn't leave ya'll high and dry, not even in a holiday special, so we do transition to some ## Q&A:.

Question this week: How much do you take for a deposit for a wedding booking?
