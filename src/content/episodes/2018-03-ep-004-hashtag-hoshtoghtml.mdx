description: "In this episode, Dustin tries to convince Steve to watch a television show named Billions and also a show named Life. Steve confesses he’s been spending all of his TV watching time at a place where everybody knows his name. On the subject of bars, Dustin is drinking a Leinenkugel and Steve is drinking a Goose Island 312 during this podcast. They waste a lot of time talking about their blogging strategies and Instagram strategies (or lack thereof), before Steve goes on a rant about those stupid big picture collage/mural things people still do on their Instagram profiles. Meanwhile, Dustin can’t even download a photo to post to his Instagram because he just can’t even."
