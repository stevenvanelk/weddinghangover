description: In this episode, Dustin tries to convince Steve to watch a television
  show named Billions and also a show named Life. Steve confesses he’s been spending
  all of his TV watching time at a place where everybody knows his name. On the subject
  of bars, Dustin is drinking a Leinenkugel and Steve is drinking a Goose Island 312
  during this podcast. They waste a lot of time talking about their blogging strategies
  and Instagram strategies (or lack thereof), before Steve goes on a rant about those
  stupid big picture collage/mural things people still do on their Instagram profiles.
  Meanwhile, Dustin can’t even download a photo to post to his Instagram because he
  just can’t even.
