We're joined this week by Heidi Thompson! A special guest so nice that she's been on the podcast twice! This week we're talking about formulating marketing plans for you business so you can minimize the amount of time you're spending on marketing while maximizing the effect your marketing has on potential clients. It's a good, good conversation even if we do get on some random tangents about potential businesses and insta-stories.

- How can I get my photo booth business off the ground without it seeming like I'm being pushy with my wedding photography clients when I offer them this service that they didn't ask about?
