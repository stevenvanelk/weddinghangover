Dealing with email spam from friends, turning your Canon camera into a webcam, sad coronavirus stories, and tearing down some abysmal facebook ads. We're also talking about drones being used to enforce social distancing, a hummingbird drone used to capture footage of monarch butterflies, and the Mavic Air 2. Also, Scotland might be closed for business till 2021.

Steve goes on a rant about frame rate and shutter speed and he's 100% wrong. And you can trust me that he's 100% wrong, because I'm Steve writing this, and I was 100% wrong. Also, let the record show that Luke McBride was 100% correct and by proxy, Dustin (which pains me to admit).

## Beer Talk:  
Steve - Repeat by Sufferfest  
Dustin - Fat Tire by New Belgium

## Q&A:  
How do you let couples know you can't shoot weddings that break their state's rules for the pandemic?  
Should photographers wear masks to weddings? What kind of masks?  
Are photographers letting couples who haven't cancelled their wedding yet block off dates next year for possible reschedules?  
Who's using their stimulus/SBA money to pay off their taxes?  
If a couple reschedules for a new date but still wants to do a ceremony on their initial date and have their photographer shoot both the small ceremony and the wedding, should they be charged more?  
How soon after your state opens for business will you start shooting? (Check out the [facebook poll in the group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/weddinghangover/permalink/2693483760889258/).)
