description: This week Steve tells a story about using manual focus with live view
  when it was too dark for his autofocus to work. It was hell. Dustin talks about
  video lights and we wonder if he's even a photographer anymore. We talk about some
  Canon, Sony, and Fuji Fast Glass stuff. Also, 'They Took Our Jobs!' That's right!
  We have an in depth and intelligent discussion of the new Skylum software coming
  out, Luminar AI, that isn't just Steve trying to get Dustin to repeat a line from
  South Park while Dustin clearly has no idea what Steve is talking about. It's very
  intelligent. Also, Steve explains Dorian Grey to Dustin, kind of...

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Some Canned Old-Fashioned thing that doesn't even have actual whisky in it  
Steve - Elijah Craig and coke and then also a Munsterfest from Three Floyds because it's been a hard few weeks so stop judging me.

## Q&A:  
If a photographer hires you to second shoot but never tells you where to be to second shoot, should you just leave and drive to the area to be there on time in case they do give you an address at the last minute?  
If a former groom gets married a second time wearing the same clothes as when he got married a few years ago while you were shooting his wedding... do you comment and mention that it's the same clothes?

Dustin talks about Tenet. Steve talks about I'm Thinking of Ending Things. They're both disappointed. Also, Dustin doesn't understand how acting works.
