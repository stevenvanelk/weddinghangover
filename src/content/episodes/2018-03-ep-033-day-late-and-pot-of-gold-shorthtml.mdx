description: "Here's a St. Patrick's Day episode that we intentionally released the day after St. Patrick's Day. Also, Dustin sent me photos of a Scottish wedding to use for the cover art, because I'm not certain he understands what St. Patrick's Day is... Anyway, in this episode Steve is drinking a Guinness, a Lagunitas Night Time, and a Heavy Seas The Alpha Effect (don't worry, he's just drinking like a half glass of each). Dustin's on that Bailey's Irish Cream."

## Show Notes:
Here's a St. Patrick's Day episode that we intentionally released the day after St. Patrick's Day. Also, Dustin sent me photos of a Scottish wedding to use for the cover art, because I'm not certain he understands what St. Patrick's Day is... 

## Beer Talk:
Anyway, in this episode Steve is drinking a Guinness, a Lagunitas Night Time, and a Heavy Seas The Alpha Effect (don't worry, he's just drinking like a half glass of each). Dustin's on that Bailey's Irish Cream.

## Topics: 
Irish Wedding traditions and ideas for a St. Patrick's Day themed wedding.

## Q&A: 
- How do you brighten up just one thing in a photo?
- Should you give family members a discount if you shoot their weddings? 
- What should you wear to a wedding on St. Patrick's Day?
- How much would it cost to get N'SYNC to play at your wedding? That last one's not really a St. Patrick's Day themed question... but there was an answer that involved leprechauns, so we included it.
