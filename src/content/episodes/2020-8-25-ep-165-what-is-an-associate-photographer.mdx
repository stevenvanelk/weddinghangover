What is an associate photographer? Is it okay to put out random requests for an associate photographer on Facebook? What should you do to train an associate photographer? We talk about associate photographers for quite some time... and also about new scams and hoaxes on the internet. Hey, here's a crazy idea.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Nap in the Hammock from Metazoa Brewing Co.  
Steve - Rubicon from 18th Street Brewery

## Q&A:
- What ISO should your Photoshop brushes be set at for rainbows?
- Does anyone know of gloves that can be used with a mouse?
- Is it malicious if a client cancels their wedding and you cut them a check for the amount of money they paid you and then they issue a chargeback through their credit card company even after receiving the check and then they ghost you?
