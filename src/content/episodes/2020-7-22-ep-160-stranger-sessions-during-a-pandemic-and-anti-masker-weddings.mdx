description: "Grab your mask, Ray Bans, and fishing hat. It's time to go full Bernie. This week we've got updates on the Copper Stallion Media story and also on the Shoot and Share controversy. We're talking Godox flashes and their iPhone app and then we're talking a lot about stranger sessions, which are super controversial right now because of the pandemic. Steve goes full grumpy old man. We're also talking about the Canon Eos R5 overheating issues (are there any?) and about the new Blackmagic 12k video camera. We also talk about the controversies with Hustle and Flow and the Do More Photographers group."

Grab your mask, Ray Bans, and fishing hat. It's time to go full Bernie. This week we've got updates on the Copper Stallion Media story and also on the Shoot and Share controversy. We're talking Godox flashes and their iPhone app and then we're talking a lot about stranger sessions, which are super controversial right now because of the pandemic. Steve goes full grumpy old man. We're also talking about the Canon Eos R5 overheating issues (are there any?) and about the new Blackmagic 12k video camera. We also talk about the controversies with Hustle and Flow and the Do More Photographers group.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Strawberry Blush wine  
Steve - Yellowstone Bourbon

## Q&A:
- What do you do if your client requests that you don't wear a mask at their wedding?
- Should you shoot a mask for an anti-masker?
- Is "COVID special pricing" just clients trying to take advantage of you when you're already struggling?
