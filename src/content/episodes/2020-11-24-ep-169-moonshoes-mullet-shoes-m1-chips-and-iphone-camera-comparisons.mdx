description: "This is our first episode back after our fraught pre-election episode. It's been a confusing anxiety filled month as our current president refuses to acknowledge that he lost the election. He lost bigly. But we're finally back with an episode full of confusing jokes and poorly done accents. We're talking about Cole Haans and Hush Puppies in followup (trademark John Siracusa) then it's on to talking about RSI issues. Steve's been having a lot. While looking for a new office chair, Steve found some humorous questions and answers on Amazon's site (Dustin doesn't find them amusing at all). We also talk about squishy things to pillow the wrist while using a keyboard and mouse and standing desk converters. Then we talk about bad SEO advice and Parler (and you thought we were done with the political talk in the opener... somebody please end it). Also, Dustin talks about his Santa sessions and Steve mentions his frustrations with Pixifi (which isn't as good as hornybook which is a software that will get you there, according to Dustin). We also spend a long time talking about the M1 chips and the new iPhone's camera (primarily as a result of Josh Wither's fantastic blog post comparing his different iPhone cameras over the years)."

This is our first episode back after our fraught pre-election episode. It's been a confusing anxiety filled month as our current president refuses to acknowledge that he lost the election. He lost bigly. But we're finally back with an episode full of confusing jokes and poorly done accents. We're talking about Cole Haans and Hush Puppies in followup (trademark John Siracusa) then it's on to talking about RSI issues. Steve's been having a lot. While looking for a new office chair, Steve found some humorous questions and answers on Amazon's site (Dustin doesn't find them amusing at all). We also talk about squishy things to pillow the wrist while using a keyboard and mouse and standing desk converters. Then we talk about bad SEO advice and Parler (and you thought we were done with the political talk in the opener... somebody please end it). Also, Dustin talks about his Santa sessions and Steve mentions his frustrations with Pixifi (which isn't as good as hornybook which is a software that will get you there, according to Dustin). We also spend a long time talking about the M1 chips and the new iPhone's camera (primarily as a result of Josh Wither's fantastic [blog post](https://joshwithers.blog/2020/10/30/comparing-the-cameras.html) comparing his different iPhone cameras over the years).

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - H 2 O (it's not a beer, he's drinking water because he's sick)  
Steve - Eirik Bloodaxe by Scarlet Lane Brewing (it is a beer, he's drinking beer despite being sick because he's an idiot)

Our recording went super long, so we're breaking Q&A up into a separate episode which will air next week.
