Masks. Masks. Masks. Masks. This week Steve and Dustin talk a lot about masks. They also talk about a crazy price drop with the Canon 5D Mark IV, the new Canon R5 and R6, Sony's vaporware Sony a7s II successor, and Canon shooting a 5D Mark III into space.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Fat Tire from New Belgium Brewing Co.  
Steve - Rum and Coke (because he ran out of beer)

## Q&A:  
Can you cancel on a client because they haven't been social distancing?  
Do you need ND filters while shooting video outside, or can you just crank that shutter baby?  
What do you do when your engagement shoot turns out to be a beach wedding?
