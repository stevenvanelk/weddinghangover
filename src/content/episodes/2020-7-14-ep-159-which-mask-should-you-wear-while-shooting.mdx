Masks. Masks. Masks. Masks. This week Steve and Dustin talk a lot about masks. They also talk about a crazy price drop with the Canon 5D Mark IV, the new Canon R5 and R6, Sony's vaporware Sony a7s II successor, and Canon shooting a 5D Mark III into space.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Fat Tire from New Belgium Brewing Co.  
Steve - Rum and Coke (because he ran out of beer)

## Q&A:
- Can you cancel on a client because they haven't been social distancing?
- Do you need ND filters while shooting video outside, or can you just crank that shutter baby?
- What do you do when your engagement shoot turns out to be a beach wedding?
