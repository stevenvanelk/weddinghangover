description: "Detective Dustin is back on the case. This time he's investigating the case of the double dipping deposits and taking a look at a twin dilemma. We're also exploring the difference between a content creator and a creative, why it's so frustrating when clients ask to see a full gallery in the venue in which they are getting married, and whether or not you need to say if a photo is from a styled shoot as opposed to a real wedding."

Detective Dustin is back on the case. This time he's investigating the case of the double dipping deposits and taking a look at a twin dilemma. We're also exploring the difference between a content creator and a creative, why it's so frustrating when clients ask to see a full gallery in the venue in which they are getting married, and whether or not you need to say if a photo is from a styled shoot as opposed to a real wedding.

## Follow up: 
Captain Pike's double booking dilemma.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Blue Moon  
Steve - Grand Junction's One With Nature IPA

## Q&A:
- What are the reasons you don't let a second shooter keep photos?
- Is there any fix for blurry photos?

At the end of the show we have a funny story from a listener who chose to embarrass Steve to no end.
