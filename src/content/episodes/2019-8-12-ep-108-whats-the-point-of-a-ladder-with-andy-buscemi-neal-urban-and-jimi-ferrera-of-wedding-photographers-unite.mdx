description: "This week, we're joined by Andy Buscemi and Neal Urban of Wedding Photographers Unite! for a joint episode! Unfortunately, Jimi Ferrara couldn't make it on the show, but we'll get him next time. This week we are talking about non-disparagement clauses, what should you do when a vendor wants to use your photos but won't meet your terms for use (crediting you as the person that took the photo), how to identify vendors you want to work with, how to handle fans of your work when they're wedding guests, Sony cameras, and drones. Neal also brings a conundrum to the table in this episode. What would you do if the videographer got in a bunch of your photos? Photoshop them out? Deliver the photos with the videographer in them?"

This week, we're joined by Andy Buscemi and Neal Urban of Wedding Photographers Unite! for a joint episode! Unfortunately, Jimi Ferrara couldn't make it on the show, but we'll get him next time. This week we are talking about non-disparagement clauses, what should you do when a vendor wants to use your photos but won't meet your terms for use (crediting you as the person that took the photo), how to identify vendors you want to work with, how to handle fans of your work when they're wedding guests, Sony cameras, and drones. Neal also brings a conundrum to the table in this episode. What would you do if the videographer got in a bunch of your photos? Photoshop them out? Deliver the photos with the videographer in them?

## Q&A:  
What is the explanation for a ladder prop?  
In boudoir photography, what is the explanation for a pole prop?  
If the guests are let into the venue early and that keeps you from getting an empty venue shot, then is there any way to clear the venue or what should you do?

At the end of the show Dustin and I talk for a little while about The Boys, Unreal, Altered Carbon, and Another Life.

And we even get a short little message from the man missing in action, Jimi Ferrara, at the very end.
