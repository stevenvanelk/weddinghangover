description: This is kind of a weird episode in that it's more serious than usual.
  You know how sometimes when you're a douchebag every conversation becomes a podcast
  (sorry, replace douchebag with podcaster). Well, that's what I did to Jenn. We were
  just talking through what the experience of shooting with an iPhone was like and
  I recorded the conversation to help me as I went to write a blog post about it later...
  and that turned into this episode.
