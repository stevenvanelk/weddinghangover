description: "This is kind of a weird episode in that it's more serious than usual. You know how sometimes when you're a douchebag every conversation becomes a podcast (sorry, replace douchebag with podcaster). Well, that's what I did to Jenn. We were just talking through what the experience of shooting with an iPhone was like and I recorded the conversation to help me as I went to write a blog post about it later... and that turned into this episode."

This is kind of a weird episode in that it's more serious than usual. You know how sometimes when you're a douchebag every conversation becomes a podcast (sorry, replace douchebag with podcaster). Well, that's what I did to Jenn. We were just talking through what the experience of shooting with an iPhone was like and I recorded the conversation to help me as I went to write a blog post about it later... and that turned into this episode.

We're donating all the money we make this month toÂ [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/). Dustin is matching however much money we make, so dip into the Patreon and sign up for one of the tiers and then delete that subscription as soon as the money clears so you're not charged next month (unless you want to help us raise money for another cause next month, cause next month we're donating the proceeds of the podcast to The Trevor Project).
