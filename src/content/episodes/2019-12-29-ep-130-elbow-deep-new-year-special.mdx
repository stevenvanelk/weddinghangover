Just before 2020. The New Year special is up. We're talking about goals for the new year. We're talking about resolutions. We're also talking about the mistakes we're trying to avoid in the new year.

## Beer Talk:  
Dustin - Fistmas Ale from Revolution Brewing  
Steve - Duvel

## Q&A:
- How can you stay up till midnight at a New Years Eve wedding?
- Should you dress differently for a NYE wedding? What if you have a cute dress with a plunging neckline but it's a Victorian themed NYE wedding?
- What should I do if my camera was sprayed with champagne at a wedding and broke and now a NYE wedding has informed me that they also want to do a champagne spray shot?
