## Beer Talk:
Steve's sick, so he asked his wife Jenn to step in for him this week on the podcast. But it's okay, because he grabbed her a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA before he went to bed for the night. 

## Follow Up:
First Jenn and Dustin are following up on some topics from past episodes. Ulices Del Toro of the [Wedding Photo Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wedding-photo-podcast/id1332942767?mt=2) wrote in to update us on Style Me Pretty. It's not dead yet. Phantom Producer Louie Novak didn't end up having strep throat... but he did have the flu. You'll have to listen to the episode to see what happened to him with regard to wedding he had to shoot shortly after he found out he was sick though.

## Show Notes:
Now, done with follow up and on to the main show... After Dustin takes us down a tangent asking Jenn about her wedding photography origins. Then they talk about NVIDIA's new content aware fill AI that's way better than Adobe Photoshop's content aware fill. Next up they talk about how photographers should talk with potential clients, and about a big faux pa that a photographer recently made while communicating with a potential client that's making the rounds on social media
