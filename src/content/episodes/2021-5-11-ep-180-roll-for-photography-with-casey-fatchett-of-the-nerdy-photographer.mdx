description: "This week Steve talks with Casey Fatchett of the Nerdy Photographer. They talk a lot about Casey's podcast and how he makes it. They also talk about his Heiland 3-Cell Flash Gun. Look it's a pretty tangent heavy episode where Casey mostly entertains Steve with stories about being an actor. He was up for a roll in Vanilla Sky and he was up to do the voice of the Geico Gecko, and he shares with Steve why he didn't get those parts. It's all interlaced with chat about photography and the need for self-care so you don't die shooting weddings."

This week Steve talks with Casey Fatchett of the Nerdy Photographer. They talk a lot about Casey's podcast and how he makes it. They also talk about his Heiland 3-Cell Flash Gun. Look it's a pretty tangent heavy episode where Casey mostly entertains Steve with stories about being an actor. He was up for a roll in Vanilla Sky and he was up to do the voice of the Geico Gecko, and he shares with Steve why he didn't get those parts. It's all interlaced with chat about photography and the need for self-care so you don't die shooting weddings.

## Beer Talk:  
Casey - 90/~ Wee Heavy from Belhaven Brewery and also some scotch.  
Steve - Moon Rambler IPA from Founders Brewing Co.

## Q&A:
- If I roll a critical fail while shooting a wedding that's making everyone roll to determine how well they'll do (they love DnD)... do I have to critically fail?
- Should I ask clients if I can bring my own weed to smoke while shooting their weddings since my clients stopped sharing their joints during the pandemic?
- What sort of wrap can I put on my camera body that looks professional but still shows off my inner nerd? (I would consider anything Doctor Who, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Star Gate or Farscape related, no Star Wars please)
- How can I get a client to stop leaving gross emoji memos on venmo when I sell them stuff? My friends think this guy is paying me for sex because it's all eggplant gush or peach gush every time I make a sale to him.
