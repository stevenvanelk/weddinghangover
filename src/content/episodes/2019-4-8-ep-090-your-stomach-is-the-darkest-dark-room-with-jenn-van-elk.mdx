description: "Unfortunately this week Dustin was unable to record, so we brought in Jennifer Van Elk to make that sweet, sweet magic happen. We talk about an indecent proposal first heard about on the I Don’t Give An F-Stop Podcast, Granny’s Red Rocket, Bride’s claiming that their photographer left them high and dry, beer that processes film, and couples that had to wait 50 years to get their wedding photos."

Unfortunately this week Dustin was unable to record, so we brought in Jennifer Van Elk to make that sweet, sweet magic happen. We talk about an [indecent proposal first heard about on the I Don’t Give An F-Stop Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-13-clenched-b-holes-season-2-premiere/id1396794953?i=1000433720675), Granny’s Red Rocket, Bride’s claiming that their photographer left them high and dry, beer that processes film, and couples that had to wait 50 years to get their wedding photos.

## Beer Talk:  
Jenn classed things up bringing the Granny’s Red Rockett wine from Tonne Winery in Muncie, Indiana.

## Q&A:
- Should you be marketing in your town’s yard sale Facebook page? How about on Nextdoor?
- Do you charge the same amount for parent albums if they’re identical?
- Can you cancel a booking if a you get a better booking?
- What should you do if the bride’s sister who is a photographer leaves you a negative review?
