description: "This week Steve and Dustin talk to Kathy Netti and Mollie Beach of Kodak Professional about Kodak Professional Select. This is a new software/service from Kodak Professional that helps photographers cull their photo shoots quickly by using AI to group photos and surface the best photos, so that you don't have to look at all the photos where your subjects are blinking. Kodak Professional Select also helps you cull details too by grouping photos of objects in a similar way to how it does photos of people, so you can pick out the most in focus, best looking detail shots from your wedding day too. Steve and Dustin also pitch some pretty great ideas to Kathy and Mollie for Kodak Professional to use going off the basis of this amazing technology, like a special Midnight Edition of the software.Watch the episode on YouTube:"
