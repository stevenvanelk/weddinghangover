description: "This week on the podcast, we're talking about some wedding businesses that were put on blast on social media... right after some quick follow up and drink discussion. Steve's drinking a Lagunita's Lag and Dustin's drinking a White Russian, or just milk. Then we're talking about a bug in an IFTTT formula causing people to post three times to Twitter for every one Instagram post they put up, and on the subject of social media Dustin and Steve talk about Linktr.ee. Next up, we talk about the bizarre case of a wedding dress shop in Dustin's hometown that went out of business after getting some bad reviews on social media, which seemed to be warranted. Then we talk about a wedding photography company in Canada that went out of business after a client went on social media to take the company down, but in this case a Canadian court found that the client was actually in the wrong."

This week on the podcast, we're talking about some wedding businesses that were put on blast on social media... right after some quick follow up and drink discussion. Steve's drinking a Lagunita's Lag and Dustin's drinking a White Russian, or just milk. Then we're talking about a bug in an IFTTT formula causing people to post three times to Twitter for every one Instagram post they put up, and on the subject of social media Dustin and Steve talk about Linktr.ee. Next up, we talk about the bizarre case of a wedding dress shop in Dustin's hometown that went out of business after getting some bad reviews on social media, which seemed to be warranted. Then we talk about a wedding photography company in Canada that went out of business after a client went on social media to take the company down, but in this case a Canadian court found that the client was actually in the wrong.

Then it's on to ## Q&A:! Questions this week: Is it plagiarism to do a shoot in an ugly location? You know, because Katelyn Maggart did it already? (we eventually realize the question asker got her name wrong, don't worry). Why do some photographers act like you're the worst person in the world if you ask them where they took a photo? What's your favorite indoor lens?
