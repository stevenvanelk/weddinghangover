description: "This week we talk about how Dustin tried to murder Steve in cold blood but make it look like an accident. I don't know what else there is to write about here... Lightroom Masks, I guess? Steve almost died for this episode art. Wake up people, Dustin attempted to murder him. Why isn't anyone calling the cops? Does no one read these show notes? A man's life is on the line."

This week we talk about how Dustin tried to murder Steve in cold blood but make it look like an accident. I don't know what else there is to write about here... Lightroom Masks, I guess? Steve almost died for this episode art. Wake up people, Dustin attempted to murder him. Why isn't anyone calling the cops? Does no one read these show notes? A man's life is on the line.

## Q&A:
- What would you do if another photographer hired you for a shoot and then lied about how the shoot went as a marketing ploy for their business?
- How do you respond to clients asking for discounts because they went on too many vacations?
