## Topics:
The case of the crazy edits, the flat tire on the way to a wedding, what to do at the same venue, take two, and thoughts on IGTV one week in. It's a strong way to start the show. Steve's drinking a Vane from Scarlet Lane. Then we're on to the show! Steve's angry that some people told a photographer to lie to her clients when a card corrupted and she lost photos. What parts of the wedding day do we feel like it's pointless to capture. Do we do father/daughter reveals?

## Q&A:

- How can you find out what rules a minister might have for the photographer?
- Do you have any tips, advice or equipment that's a must have for an engagement shoot?
