Here’s that meme we talked about in the opener:

First up we're talking follow up this week, and specifically we're talking more about the Sony Pony situation. Next up Dustin updates us on how the free bridal show went and then we slide into the show and talk about what makes for a good lead from a bridal show. After that we're talking about an email we received that we assume is fake, but that is funny as hell to talk about. Someone wanted to know how they could avoid sleeping with someone at a conference after they already slept with them at a previous conference.

## Beer Talk:

Dustin - Nothing... but he has a story about a bourbon Bloody Mary.  
Steve - Corona Extra.

## Q&A:
- Is it copyright infringement if a real estate agent sends one of your photos out to someone else to have a twilight sky added into it without your permission?
- Have you ever thought you made a mistake but then when you started editing realized you loved what you did?
- Does anyone else sketch out images that they want to photograph?
