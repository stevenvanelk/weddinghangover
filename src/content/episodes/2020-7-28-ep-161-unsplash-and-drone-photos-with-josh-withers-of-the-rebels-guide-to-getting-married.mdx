description: "This week Steve is joined by Josh Withers of the Rebel's Guide to Getting Married. Steve and Josh talk about COVID-19 cancellations, unsplash, and drone photos. They also talk about facial manipulation in photos that people do to get those big beautiful anime eyes, just like Josh's eyes in the episode art (which is definitely not a horrifically photoshopped image that Steve made with a photo of Josh's from Unsplash). Steve and Josh also talk about laminar, anthropics, and AI editors. Josh also shares about how to get great audio when you're shooting video (which is always a struggle... I mean, listen to the disclaimer at the beginning of the episode). There's also an adorable guest at the end of the show, but you'll have to watch the video if you want to be blown away by how cute Luna Withers is."
