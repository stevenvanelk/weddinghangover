description: "This week we’re joined by professional wedding guest, Morgan Roberts! Morgan is a wedding photographer from Moggill in Australia, just outside of Brisbane. We talk with Morgan about getting groped at a wedding, seeing a punch up at a wedding, watching an uncle get into a biffer… and that’s all just one story. We also talk with Morgan about weird copyright requests, Nikon vs. Fujifilm, and breaking out of a three month slump where he didn’t book any new weddings."

This week we’re joined by professional wedding guest, Morgan Roberts! Morgan is a wedding photographer from Moggill in Australia, just outside of Brisbane. We talk with Morgan about getting groped at a wedding, seeing a punch up at a wedding, watching an uncle get into a biffer… and that’s all just one story. We also talk with Morgan about weird copyright requests, Nikon vs. Fujifilm, and breaking out of a three month slump where he didn’t book any new weddings.

## Beer Talk:  
Morgan - Two 3 Bolt Pale Ales from Green Beacon Brewing Co.  
Steve - Bean Counter and InvEster from Taxman Brewing Co.  
Dustin - Nap in the Hammock from Metazoa

## Q&A
- Do I need shark attack insurance for my surfing Santa sessions? Also, how do I keep Santa’s skin from getting prune-y?
- How can I get the okay to do a styled shoot with polyamorous kangaroos if their owner is dead set against it since they aren’t monogamous?
- What should you do if your client likes your photos a lot and recommends you to a bunch of other people, but never says they love the photos?
- Should I ask the client to replace my camera if someone got a smidge of butter and chicken on it at a wedding? UPDATE: I AM VEGAN AND MY CAMERA HAS BEEN TAINTED BY PROCESSED BOVINE EXPRESSIONS AND DEAD FOWL MEAT, SO IF YOU’RE A LEATHER STRAP TOTING DILDO JUST MOVE ON TO ANOTHER QUESTION!
