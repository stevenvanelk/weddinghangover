description: This week we're talking Christmas gifts and the things we missed in 2020
  and the things we're looking forward to in 2021. But it's mostly not holiday related.
  We have updates on birds that rhyme with Sony as well as updates on more terrible
  things that Pass is doing. We're also talking about the longest exposure photo ever
  taken, a touchpad replacement for a shutter button and DJI being put on the economic
  blacklist. Plus, drone photos of landscapes that look rather phallic. Nature's d**k
  pics.

## Beer Talk:  
Steve - Exemption from Taxman Brewing Company  
Dustin - Yellowstone Bourbon

## Q&A:  
What do you do if a second shooter takes a bunch of photos that aren't deliverable in any way, shape or form?  
Should you switch from Android to iPhone so your photography business brand seems more luxurious?  
Is it okay to not pay a photographer for their work if they showed up late with a child?
