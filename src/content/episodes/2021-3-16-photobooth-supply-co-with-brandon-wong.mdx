#This week Steve was joined by Brandon Wong of the Photobooth Supply Co. Brandon talked to Steve about why he transitioned from being a wedding photographer to creating a photobooth company that could help photographers and other event vendors make more money. Brandon and Steve also talk about the changes Photobooth Supply Co. made this last year to help their clients keep earning money during the pandemic, and they also talk a little bit about the future of photobooths.

## Q&A:  
Where do you get your jumpsuits for conferences?  
Where do you think AR fits into the future of photobooths?  
Do you have to encourage guests at events to take dick pics or does that just happen organically?  
If a skunk sprays your salsa photobooth can you clean off the stank with tomato juice?
