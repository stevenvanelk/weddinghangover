Adobe, a company best known for designing software intended to slow down webpages and open up users’ computers to a multitude of viruses and scam advertisements, made an unprecedented move this week to help out struggling creatives. The pandemic has taken a toll on many industries, and the photography industry is no exception. Concerned that photographers were experiencing high levels of stress and depression during the pandemic, Adobe stepped up to help out in a big way. They released an app update to Lightroom Mobile for iOS that removes the mental burden of unfinished projects and erases the memories of better days.

We reached out to Adobe for a comment on their bold move to erase photos and presets from Lightroom Mobile and while they couldn’t officially give us a statement, they did proudly state in their [public forums](https://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/lost-my-pictures-and-presets-after-update-today-18th-august-2020) that the missing photos and presets were “not recoverable.” While unable to obtain a public statement, our sources at Adobe did have a lot to say about this amazing new development on the condition of anonymity.

“We’ve been really bummed out by how bummed out so many of our users have been due to the pandemic. We know a lot of them are struggling to finish their work because of the debilitating stress caused by the current situation. We knew that we had an easy solution to alleviate that stress. If you don’t have the photos, you can’t finish the edits. The stress is gone. It’s that simple.

“Look, it’s not all about the stress of work though. A lot of users were also bummed out while looking at photos in Lightroom because it reminded them of the times when they could go out. This is the closest any company has ever come to be able to erase bad memories, and I don’t think enough people are talking about this breakthrough. I’m not asking you to pat my back… but you probably should.”

We asked our sources at Adobe if they were afraid any of their competitors would follow suit and make similar bold moves. This remark was met with laughter and the comment, “What competitors?”
