description: "Greta Thunberg shocked the videography world today when she begged and pleaded with Canon videographers to stop shooting 8K video with their Canon EOS R5 cameras. Thunberg cited the R5 as being the second biggest contributing factor to global warming, right after cryptocurrency miners using ASICs. In the wake of this startling revelation you’d hope to see videographers across the globe announcing that they’ll be leaving Canon for Sony, Nikon, or Fujifilm, all camera brands known for staying cool during use. However, what we’ve seen across the internet since this startling news is Canon videographers asking questions about how they can use their R5 to mine bitcoin."

Greta Thunberg shocked the videography world today when she begged and pleaded with Canon videographers to stop shooting 8K video with their Canon EOS R5 cameras. Thunberg cited the R5 as being the second biggest contributing factor to global warming, right after cryptocurrency miners using ASICs. In the wake of this startling revelation you’d hope to see videographers across the globe announcing that they’ll be leaving Canon for Sony, Nikon, or Fujifilm, all camera brands known for staying cool during use. However, what we’ve seen across the internet since this startling news is Canon videographers asking questions about how they can use their R5 to mine bitcoin.

We reached out to Canon for comment and were given this statement. “We’re very pleased to have the most talked about and hottest camera on the market. Attempts to turn a Canon R5 into a Bitcoin mining machine would of course void the warranty. We’d encourage our clients not to hack their cameras to turn them into lucrative money making machines, but if someone were to crack that nut we’d point out that the R5 is weather-proof so liquid cooling might be your best bet theoretically.“

During the last year while the world was mostly shutdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it almost looked like the rate of climate change was slowing dramatically. At one point it even seemed like new ice might be freezing in place around the polar ice caps. Then Canon released the EOS R5 and within one week the polar ice caps were back to melting at their pre-lockdown rate. Thunberg was last seen yelling and crying, “Why Canon?! Whyyyyyyy?”
