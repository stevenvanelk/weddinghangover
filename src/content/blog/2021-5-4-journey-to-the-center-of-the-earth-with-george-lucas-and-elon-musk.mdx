description: George Lucas and Elon Musk announced today that they’ll be undertaking
  a joint venture to burrow to the center of the earth and record what they find there.
  People are baffled by why two men whose names seem synonymous with space would be
  interested in exploring the depths of our earth. We reached to Lucas and Musk for
  comment on the situation.

George Lucas and Elon Musk announced today that they’ll be undertaking a joint venture to burrow to the center of the earth and record what they find there. People are baffled by why two men whose names seem synonymous with space would be interested in exploring the depths of our earth. We reached to Lucas and Musk for comment on the situation.

Musk refused to comment, but could be heard muttering about dogecoin for hours after forgetting that he had answered the phone and failed to hang up.

Lucas had this message to share, “The first three movies in the Star Wars trilogy, most people think they’re fantasy. They’re actually historical fiction. I’ve been obsessed with space since I was a child and in my teen years I picked up some intergalactic space broadcasts. After years of decoding the language, I finally got the stories from the broadcasts that would become what some people refer to as the original trilogy. The rest I just kind of made up when I realized that toy sales were flagging in the 90s.”

After our reporter exclaimed, “Anakin, Shmi and Qui-Gonn! This, this has nothing to do with the announcement about burrowing to the center of the [expletive deleted] Earth!” Lucas continued, “Who knows what we’ll find at the center. The curiosity is killing me. I mean, there could be millions of new toys down there for me to sell, and wouldn’t that be great? But we just don’t know. Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if we get down to what scientists think is the molten core of the earth and we just find a 2016 MacBook Pro with 45 tabs open in Google Chrome dancing a jig with a Canon EOS R5 shooting 8K video. It could be anything, but given the immense heat down there, my money’s on the R5 and the MacBook Pro.”
