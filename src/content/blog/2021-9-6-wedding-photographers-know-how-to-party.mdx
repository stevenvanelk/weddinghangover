Rob Sherril Photography: *“Thank you so much for reaching out to me! I’m currently shooting a wedding but will get back to you as soon as possible. At the very latest, expect a response by 8 AM tomorrow morning.”*

Dope AF!

Cindy Lomack Photography: *“Hey guys! I’m heading from a sunrise elopement to a sunset elopement, but I just got a call to see if I could fill in for a friend at a a noon wedding party, so I can’t talk. Let’s try this again sometime.”*

Oh hell yeah! That sounds wicked fun!

Ryan Blakey Photography: *“Today’s a holiday? Shit! Shit! Shit! I dropped my kids off at the bus stop on my way to my wedding! Could one of you swing by the house to make sure they’re alright?”*

This guy’s an animal! It’s a party in the U-S-A! Hope all you international wedding photographers reading this take some lessons on how to cut loose!

We stopped the interviews at this point to swing by the Blakely house and take the kids for ice cream. Hope everyone else is out there partying hard.
