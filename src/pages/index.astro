        <p>
          We’re a podcast and a blog. Presumably this is all about wedding photography, but in reality it’s just about photography in general.
          If you find yourself here, heed these wise words before looking any further:
          “Sell your camera. Take a vacation. Rethink your life.”
          If those words don’t resonate deep within your soul, this probably isn’t the place for you.
