        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why We Do This</h2>
        <p>
          There are a lot of great podcasts out there that will claim to teach you everything you need to know about photography and shooting weddings. We are not that podcast.
          Why not? Because we’re the best photography podcast, and we know that education is boring and depressing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let’s face it, the world is a depressing place sometimes — and running a wedding photography business doesn’t shelter you from the downtimes.
          This podcast exists to help you decompress, and if you need, to laugh the horrors of this unforgiving world away. That got dark.

        <p>
          Other podcasts give you takeaways. Things you can takeaway from the podcast and apply to your business.
          We firmly believe it will be best if you leave behind everything you hear on our podcast.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only takeaways we hope you have at the end of each episode is a smile on your face, a pep in your step, and a flutter in your heart.

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Steve</h2>
        <img src="/images/why/steve-jenn.webp" alt="This is Steve!" class="profile-image" />
        <p>
          Steven Van Elk was 5th Grade Paddle Ball Champion at his school growing up. And in case you were wondering if he defended his title in 6th Grade at East Side Elementary — you better believe it baby!
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years he’s put the paddle down and picked up a camera. He’s a photographer in Noblesville, Indiana, shooting weddings for over 10 years with his wife Jenn under Van Elk & Co.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Dustin, Steve has tripped and fallen and hit his head while shooting weddings — and several times on commercial shoots. He’s missing some brain cells and it’s safe to say he has much to learn from his mentor, Dustin, about head safety.

        <p><strong>Likes:</strong> Spicy food, beer, bathroom mirror selfies, and podcasting greatness.</p>
        <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Dustin’s bridge-tripping camera.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Dustin</h2>
        <img src="/images/why/dustin-corynn.webp" alt="This is Dustin!" class="profile-image" />
        <p>
          Dustin McKibben couldn’t be bothered to write his own bio, so I (Steve) did it for him. Dustin is a photographer in Fort Wayne, Indiana. No one brings the awesome quite like Dustin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s been shooting weddings for over 10 years and has never tripped over a camera. He also does a lot of commercial and real estate work under the name Art Home Photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dustin has never hit his head during a shoot. He’s a real pro. Truly, a man of safety and wisdom.
